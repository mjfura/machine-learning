      "[\"i loved this show growing up and i still watch the first season dvd at age (oov) today what can i say i grew up in a house much like the one on full house i had a dad two sisters and a dog i guess the only difference was that i did not live with my uncle and my (oov) best friend also i grew up with my mom in the house i don't know what i would have done without full house on television i think that (oov) played by (oov) (oov) d j played by kirk (oov) sister (oov) and michelle played by mary kate and ashley (oov) are my favorite characters i can relate to each of them because i am the middle child of my family like (oov) i am a younger sister like michelle and i am an older sister like d j i really like how the show always has moral values because i don't really like any of the o c like shows today i like the comedy of full house too uncle jesse john (oov) joey dave (oov) and danny bob (oov) are hilarious as the (oov) uncle (oov) friend and dad (oov) the story goes that after the (oov) mom dies (oov) best friend joey and his brother in law jesse move in to help raise the kids three men trying to raise three young girls hilarious each character on full house is full of heart funny and genuinely believable joey is an (oov) comedian with a (oov) heart and soul jesse is the cool (oov) riding tough guy uncle who is (oov) by his three (oov) and later his wife (oov) (oov) (oov) from (oov) both kids and adults will love this show (oov)\", \"i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer the end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was (oov) lake in the black hills bring the (oov) stop the (oov) etc so this (oov) youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local (oov) (oov) was being (oov) so the shooting scenes were for real yes (oov) animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was (oov) by jack nicholson in the shining a great western social comment from the 50's this should be in the same class as high (oov) for real western drama or used as a social statement like (oov) jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50's youth\", \"full house came to me when i was about 9 i remember seeing re runs of (oov) funniest home videos with bob (oov) and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house one day i was lucky enough to catch an episode while (oov) family it didn't seem too interesting at first but as i watched more and more ever night at 9 00 i would just be so into it this show really makes you want to be there yourself hang out with the girls go places with them and maybe even join in their little family sing (oov) the thing i like most about full house is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages there will be some parts that are more for adults then parts that are meant for kids so that the whole family will enjoy it no matter how cheesy it can be it's still a great show and i would definitely recommend it to anyone 10 10\", \"i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless he she is a critic or a person who (oov) story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to (oov) and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office school it makes you laugh and it is not just humor yes the (oov) family is a perfect family a perfectly (oov) family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in (oov) a (oov) family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later on another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those (oov) talks with michelle are extremely touching if one doesn't think of it as childish overall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a (oov) in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows\", \"i grew up watching full house as a child i stopped watching it for years but about two weeks ago i started back watching it again now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well my kids can't believe that (oov) on the show and i are the same age i really love the show because it is a show you can watch with your family it has good (oov) your kids can learn from also there isn't any drugs and violence on it also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help that's the message kids should be getting from tv now a days turn to your family for help not to drugs kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a days i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth it talks about real life problems and family matters there is always a lesson you can learn from the show i vote the show a 10\", 'full house is a wonderful sitcom that is about a dad danny (oov) whose wife had just died in a car crash so danny asks his brother in law jesse (oov) and best friend joey (oov) to help raise his three girls donna (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) and michelle (oov) this is my favorite show ever and i can watch it all day long and something on full house is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also there is never a dull moment in full house the main characters are played by bob (oov) danny (oov) john (oov) jesse (oov) dave (oov) joey (oov) (oov) cameron (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) and mary kate ashley (oov) michelle (oov)', \"i really did not watch this show as often when i was a child but the first episode i remember ever seeing is the episode where (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) ears when i started high school back in 2000 i had problems all through out high school and i'd rather not get into that but i used to always watch saved by the bell but that show really reminded me of the problems i faced at school and it rarely showed the kids parents saved by the bell is okay but not a good family show a few days after i (oov) high school in 2004 i turned the tv to the family channel and day after day i got (oov) to full house i could even push the (oov) button and see the year it came out and i would remember what i was doing during that time period the episode was about to come on and it was titled birthday blues and to this day it is most favorite episode it's sad with a happy ending and you see (oov) (oov) in a way she doesn't act in other episodes she actually shows her serious side i have seasons 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 on dvd and i am waiting for 7 and 8 i wished somehow they could have a documentary and some (oov) from the cast members i don't why some people have a hatred for this show because you don't see trash and violence on this show and for those who hate this show i (oov) for you because you might have grown up in a (oov) family where there was no love but full house in my opinion is a family living in heaven where everyone is happy and good things always happen and the characters are so awesome danny (oov) reminds me of my mother and grandmother joey is good (oov) and is always in a good mood when i was a child i used to be just like jesse and he is the first actor on tv as a guy that is so obsessed with hair somehow you can actually tell that (oov) is a california girl i really like the episodes with (oov) (oov) because she always makes me smile and (oov) my day when i watch her and (oov) is so cool also i have a hard time telling the (oov) (oov) apart i want my kids to watch it one day but full house is my 1 favorite show and (oov) the teenage witch is my 2 favorite one day (oov) before i die i would really like to meet all the cast of full house in person the first 3 seasons are kinda boring but they start getting better in the (oov) season i just wished they could have made a (oov) season they stopped making full house in (oov) and in the fall of 1996 (oov) the teenage witch came out which is a similar family show but full house is a very loving show and they have their good times and bad times and yes i understand if your a wild trashy type person your going to hate this show but this is a show for happiness and it is also moral show also i would like to say that the first 3 seasons is good kid shows but around the (oov) and (oov) seasons (oov) and (oov) become teenagers also i noticed not only with full house but a lot of shows they never talk about the problems in the world and politics like when full house was on the air during the (oov) war in (oov) and during the time of the (oov) city (oov) in (oov) they never mention anything about it also steve was my favorite (oov) boyfriend the ones with (oov) and nelson (oov) very interesting but season 5 and 6 i think are the best i just wished they would have made a (oov) season because it left a big question mark in my head because on the last episode in the last minute (oov) gets a surprise and goes to her prom with her ex boyfriend steve i always wondered if they got back together and i liked how in the final seasons (oov) was always the (oov) one and (oov) was always wanting to do something daring like in the episode (oov) wild ride\", \"full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again i've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to (oov) themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy it's not like i hate it but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the first full house is about (oov) danny (oov) bob (oov) and his three daughters d j (oov) cameron (oov) (oov) (oov) and michelle mary kate and ashley when (oov) wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave (oov) and the (oov) uncle jesse john (oov) moves in with them once they live there together they find they can't live without each other full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again\", 'this show is about three little girls d j (oov) and michelle their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny (oov) his brother in law jesse and his old friend joey so the whole show is about living life the girls go through (oov) troubles and have life lessons they develop (oov) (oov) and many more the whole show is basically about to go with the flow you do not have to hold (oov) you just have to let it go i think this show is really good and fun to watch i grew up watching this show and still watch it today i am glad they still air this show on television i watch it almost every day i rate it 10 10', \"ok who brought the cheese i love it during it's run it became a (oov) the (oov) (oov) became popular bob (oov) started making a (oov) instead of his really funny stand up and people knew who dave (oov) was this is when life was good and simple this is one of the great american classics it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson and this is where i (oov) from the (oov) i liked the last few seasons like home improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script this is why i dare say it could have gone much later than it did but anyway i gave it an 8 10 because of its (oov) funny story lines and because of bob (oov)\", \"i love full house so much that i couldn't live without full house why did it end it (oov) a lot of the fan of it can we have a full house ii oh come on but it is better that we have those dvd to help us but i need those real ones to come up with another new episode love warmth are filled the house all the characters are very cute and handsome (oov) cameron mary kate and ashley (oov) (oov) (oov) bob (oov) dave (oov) and john (oov) (oov) you (oov) michelle (oov) danny joey and jesse please come back to the screen please how is michelle after falling down from a horse how are (oov) and alex is joey alone or is he having a wife or at least a girlfriend are they still living in the same house i want to continue the life of full house and please don't upset me\", \"i try to watch it everyday most of the time and even though i have watched it for the past 4 years i have not seen every episode the show is about danny (oov) who is guy who does news for sports his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse an elvis (oov) with a (oov) and has an obsession of his hair joey an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls donna joe they call her d j (oov) who is the second (oov) and michelle the (oov) they all live under one (oov) with no one to help them out later in the show jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have (oov) (oov) and alex this starts to happen in the new seasons this show is awesome if you like the (oov) life of (oov) and (oov) that's so (oov) boy meets world and (oov) woman you will love this it starts to get better in the ending seasons watch it you will love it\", 'i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in (oov) looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more (oov) and correct than say blue soldier the (oov) (oov) (oov) are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with (oov) the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the (oov) killing (oov) of the late (oov) probably because those in the movie were real killing (oov) the movie was shot during legal (oov) directed (oov) (oov) so the animals you see are really being shot the (oov) are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot', \"full house was and still is a great show it's a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really aren't any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though it's a bit cheesy it's still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast (oov) now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the (oov) spot website and sign a (oov) titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a (oov) for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it (oov) for full house\", \"full house in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it one of my favorite episodes is where jesse john (oov) and (oov) (oov) (oov) get married if you want to know how what made it so funny you'd have to have seen it for yourself it was a two (oov) so you'd have to have seen both parts another one of my favorite episodes is where jesse (oov) (oov) (oov) and michelle mary kate ashley (oov) get locked in a gas station on (oov) birthday you'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened i have many other ones that i like too everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in (oov) now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good\", 'this is how i feel about the show i started watching the show in (oov) in 2001 i enjoy the show but it had too many faults i hate the michelle joey characters stealing story lines from old tv shows they even stole from the (oov) family then in 1 episode the (oov) family was mentioned actors playing different roles in different episodes (oov) (oov) (oov) the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in 1 episode the michelle character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out revenge to her sisters for a joke by them on her story lines that came went in 1 episode joey getting the tv show with (oov) (oov) never heard from it again after that danny all of a sudden playing the (oov) 1 episode he is (oov) soccer 1 episode he is (oov) (oov) baseball 1 game you are out huh danny jesse joey keep getting jobs really quickly with no experience only in a tv show i did like the d j (oov) characters wish (oov) (oov) could have learned from (oov) cameron (oov) had a clean non drug adult life', \"this show has a great storyline it's very believable a (oov) wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show such as (oov) (oov) the lovable yet strong dog (oov) (oov) and alex who you can find out for yourself i don't want to spoil it for you and of (oov) (oov) (oov) the sidekick of (oov) but the kids are wonderful too this is mary kate and ashley first took off and also you may know (oov) cameron (oov) from shows like st (oov) (oov) (oov) and that's so (oov) (oov) (oov) plays (oov) the love able middle child who feels left out really this is a very good show\", \"i have never seen a show as good as full house full house puts all of the (oov) shows to shame big time anyone who has never seen it which i don't see how it is possible should see it it is a great show for anyone of any age full house will make you laugh it will make you cry it will (oov) you true some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out (oov) all of the cheesy aspects full house ran it's first episode on september (oov) 1987 (oov) our very first show and ran it's last episode on may (oov) (oov) (oov) michelle (oov) again part ii the plot of the show is very believable danny (oov) bob (oov) (oov) his wife (oov) in an accident involving a drunk driver danny has his brother in law jesse (oov) john (oov) which is (oov) younger brother and danny also brings in his best friend joey (oov) dave (oov) to help him raise his three daughters (oov) daughters are named (oov) (oov) cameron (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) and michelle mary kate and ashley (oov) joey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years which is the number of years the show ran for the following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor actress who played him her john (oov) jesse john (oov) is a great actor he plays jesse jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break in full house john (oov) does a great job portraying his character he looked and played music like his (oov) elvis (oov) bob (oov) danny bob (oov) is also a great actor he (oov) his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver he has to raise three girls without a having the girl's mother bob (oov) does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls dave (oov) joey one word can describe dave (oov) funny he is great playing the character of joey was perfect for him he does a great job playing the stand up comedian waiting for his big break (oov) cameron (oov) (oov) she is a tremendous actress she plays the (oov) sister (oov) which is short for donna (oov) she is one of the best actresses i have ever seen her acting ability in full house was very believable (oov) (oov) (oov) two simple words can describe (oov) (oov) incredibly amazing i wish i could say every thing that i would like to say about (oov) but i would use up the 1 000 word (oov) just on her she got her start in a kids show called mother (oov) stories and when she came to full house she blew the (oov) and (oov) mind her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was according to dave (oov) (oov) was supposed to be the star of the show it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break (oov) at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly she showed great enthusiasm most young kids can't do this as you can probably guess (oov) (oov) (oov) is my favorite character in full house mary kate and ashley (oov) michelle great actress full house is where they got their start they received the part of michelle because they were the only (oov) who did not cry while in front of a camera there are many more cast members that should be recognized these are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987 the only negative thing that i can say is how full house became the michelle show towards the end i think it was to focused on her towards the end especially when i think (oov) and (oov) were much better at acting full house is a great show for everyone it can teach you a lot one of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as (oov) a family member occurs full house continues to (oov) new fans with all this said there is only a couple things left to say full house will never die and thank you the cast of full house for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy\", \"i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had more important things to do plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it (oov) with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too (oov) then i realized every afternoon at five it was on (oov) and i once again became (oov) to it full house has made me laugh and cry it's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable but look at the big picture three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt the three men who live with the girls can get into (oov) at times what's any more real than that if anything the show has (oov) me up when i'm down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness i have (oov) like a (oov) at the show and (oov) a massive (oov) over mary kate and ashley (oov) of course (oov) (oov) has now taken that spot but they were literally the (oov) (oov) i have ever seen they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people\", \"i watched (oov) (oov) one night and thought it was o k but missing something maybe (oov) keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the (oov) line delivery of a leading lady the next day i kept thinking about the movie though i couldn't get (oov) song out of my head i kept trying to better remember (oov) (oov) first scene i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy the next night i watched a scene with (oov) todd as a (oov) chorus girl trying to impress (oov) and jimmy with her sex appeal a very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions so i watched another scene their show is opening on broadway (oov) in his (oov) innocence (oov) every act again i was laughing out loud (oov) (oov) (oov) and (oov) so the next night i watched the whole movie again and this time i see it for the first time it's (oov) it's (oov) it's (oov) three great (oov) todd dances (oov) sings keaton speaks sure it ain't (oov) but there's a lot of laughs in this picture\", \"since it has been some years since i (oov) this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in (oov) but first some (oov) notes from a movie critic this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood (oov) it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review (oov) or (oov) (oov) which it is called in (oov) is a great animated series it is much like (oov) and (oov) (oov) and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be (oov) now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time (oov) out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed (oov) and (oov) or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like (oov) montana or something like that yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to (oov) i would be (oov) to see these series like (oov) being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again\", \"i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was (oov) cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good\", \"thanks (oov) (oov) for creating disney's 2 best cartoons ever this show has improved very much over the years as a kid i didn't like it because i thought it was a rip off of (oov) which was my favorite disney thing at the time like (oov) then later on though it was good but not great but after reading the reviews here i decided to give it another chance bought the dvd set watched the whole pilot the first day i got it was very pleasantly surprised it's still my favorite episode although the series did live up to it and by the end of disc 1 i knew this was going to be a top (oov) the characters are so complex charming my favorite has got to be (oov) he's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot my next favorite is (oov) the best pilot on the show i can see why (oov) (oov) built the show around him then it's (oov) (oov) he (oov) have the best relationship in the series after that (oov) jim (oov) did a perfect job of (oov) the original voice after him (oov) she has made me laugh pretty hard and i do believe she and (oov) eventually marry and finally for the heroes molly although she's my least favorite i still like her i think she's a very cute character much better than (oov) from (oov) and the villains were very original don (oov) his air (oov) always crack me up (oov) is ice cold and ruthless and the (oov) are always at least amusing as said before the stories range from hilarious time (oov) for no bear romance of red (oov) to nothing short of touching the old man the (oov) (oov) lost to fun funny exciting adventures in search of ancient (oov) my favorite for whom the bell (oov) these are only a few of my favorite episodes anyway (oov) is disney's best aside from (oov) bears some reasons for this (oov) had a decent amount of my favorite character (oov) while (oov) didn't have enough of (oov) but in the end (oov) remains a classic bottom line 10 10 (oov) best cartoon ever\", 'like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie on tv never on the big screen when i was a teenager my dad has always (oov) this film highly and recommended it to me then and i must say he was not only right but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time i have seen it two or three more times since then just a few days ago i gave it another watch and it has not lost anything of its impact with time it still a great and well worth to be seen movie (oov) regard (oov) ride the high country as one of the first and best later western which had a realistic look at life in the old west but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time or maybe it still is although thinking hard and having certainly seen (oov) of western i like this genre i can not remember any western as bleak and (oov) as this one two men bound together partly by hate partly by not (oov) to have other choices surrounded by beautiful ms (oov) a (oov) old man and a young (oov) leading the life of (oov) killers until fate reaches out for one of them nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last (oov) of this gem when the camera moves on and away from mr taylor a white (oov) skin comes into sight on a tree and (oov) from the past when all the hatred began are present again mr taylor has got his (oov) but in the end the (oov) got him aside from the top performances of everybody involved the intelligent script and the great dialogue it should also be mentioned that the last hunt is superbly (oov) i have (oov) seen a western that well shot aside from the ones directed by anthony mann which are also all superbly photographed that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well and director brooks is really a superb (oov) master (oov) he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every (oov) genre but even in an as (oov) career as this one the last hunt still shines as one of his best if not his best definitely would deserve a higher rating compared to the 7 something ride the high country enjoys', \"in the year 1990 the world of disney tv cartoons was certainly at it's prime shows like (oov) n (oov) rescue rangers (oov) and (oov) bears was already popular and now disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the disney afternoon that cartoon is called (oov) it's about old jungle book character (oov) the bear as he gets a job in the plane business in the series he meets (oov) (oov) former air (oov) and good (oov) (oov) business lady (oov) (oov) and her (oov) daughter molly this series is very funny and has tons of great (oov) that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life this is one cleverly written series and it's great to add to your dvd collection parents buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible (oov) cartoons if you liked (oov) then check out (oov) (oov) and (oov) (oov) spin it\", \"(oov) (oov) what can i say that hasn't already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most well written shows i've ever (oov) live action or animation the (oov) stuff is way too (oov) down for my (oov) and some of the mature stuff i have to (oov) kids out of the room for but not (oov) the stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like (oov) (oov) and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the (oov) of the (oov) (oov) and stuck on you where the emphasis is on (oov) i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays at least those which aren't specifically (oov) toward it especially in cartoons in the episode (oov) (oov) for instance (oov) (oov) decides that he's going to join an air (oov) but (oov) believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode (oov) (oov) at (oov) to stay away from daring dan to which (oov) screams no you can't tell me what to do (oov) not my dad and (oov) his face in his (oov) the next day he leaves for the air (oov) this kind of drama is a (oov) in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays the characters have a lot of depth to them (oov) is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or (oov) a few (oov) of (oov) (oov) is a (oov) business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are (oov) good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you can't let that (oov) you she can be a real (oov) sometimes (oov) (oov) is a darker character than the rest he doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a (oov) to break off relationships watch his expression in (oov) and (oov) when he (oov) the (oov) hook he looks as though he's prepared to put it right through a (oov) in the end it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show 1 in my book the relationship between (oov) and (oov) is very real almost father and son this is (oov) well in (oov) whale that ends whale when (oov) takes (oov) word for it that (oov) is (oov) the animals in his (oov) instead of (oov) with the other adults (oov) and (oov) relationship is also realistic due to (oov) motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the (oov) sea (oov) not necessarily a desire to help (oov) but something tells me that if he did get the (oov) back he'd still do jobs for (oov) the sea (oov) not to mention all the other (oov) in the series is pretty (oov) designed the (oov) (oov) don't change once throughout the series continuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other super (oov) of other cartoons it doesn't have one single weapon on board unless you count (oov) and relies instead on it's (oov) (oov) great skill to get out of trouble it's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun (oov) (oov) (oov) or even a (oov) somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus it's just such a (oov) cool design this is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars\", 'ever since i remember i have loved (oov) and flying i am now in college with a private (oov) (oov) and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old (oov) spin (oov) in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme (oov) as i grew up and i can still re (oov) it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the (oov) soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show', \"along with (oov) (oov) this is (oov) (oov) disney has been in (oov) since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track ed (oov) and jim (oov) were perfect for the voices of louis and (oov) sounds familiar the theme theme tune is also catchy out of all the villains which are all great on their own (oov) tony jay stands out as (oov) (oov) louis and (oov) actually sound very similar to the voice (oov) in the jungle book which isn't a bad thing at all as a matter of fact it's quite (oov) the animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been (oov) lacking in (oov) for years please bring this show back 9 10 (oov) cox\", \"as for many on here i can't help but praise the cast and crew who developed (oov) and others they made throughout my childhood i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters to class this work of art as a cartoon could never do (oov) justice in fact it's an insult to class it as a cartoon (oov) is an animation and nothing less it is (oov) the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date when disney pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since i'll take a moment to explain from the first which is (oov) to the last which i think is (oov) (oov) disney has been (oov) with (oov) due to political (oov) and have taken a (oov) (oov) (oov) since they prefer (oov) over quality now not to mention the room full of (oov) for the (oov) i couldn't have my children watching the mind (oov) cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50 of the blame would be on me for (oov) them to watch it i couldn't let that happen which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a (oov) so one day my children couldn't be (oov) by the cartoon crap of today and to (oov) the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i (oov) that all to (oov) (oov) to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth charm wit (oov) emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today do you see any of that content in say ed (oov) and eddie or anything else you can think of the rubbish produced today can be (oov) to some 3 year (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) a (oov) the next time you watch an episode of (oov) take a look at the (oov) on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and (oov) over the quality of (oov) and effort put into this animation even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again the buildings look true to the art (oov) movement which was popular in the time period depicted even the (oov) are true to life ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it (oov) it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the (oov) mistakes or intended mistakes in each episode and some have two for example in (oov) deep where (oov) (oov) you're up to something (oov) and (oov) (oov) who me i'm as innocent as a (oov) take a look into (oov) eyes i won't spoil the rest of the (oov) but just keep an eye out next time everyone (oov) (oov) are bang on and 100 correct i have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here disney wake up and (oov) the coffee you have been asleep for over a decade stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into (oov) and stop producing cartoons we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as (oov) as possible\", \"spin it the 90s opened up with a clever disney favorite (oov) the

right this is the same (oov) that has brought kids such (oov) as pokemon (oov) ann mighty (oov) power rangers and (oov) (oov) please note that three of the titles mentioned above are (oov) japanese

period would be (oov) (oov) and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to (oov) (oov) for

support frank (oov) the most entertaining (oov) since (oov) on the original star trek molly (oov) cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don't have and of course in the middle

is there wasn't a (oov) of details however this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph (oov) life (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights

(oov) that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is beautiful i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a (oov) (oov) spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and (oov) i would definitely recommend watching this movie\", \"despite reading the initial comments from someone who (oov) (oov) the film why is the only negative comment very first on the list it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the (oov) joseph smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts (oov) on by the (oov) it

most importantly it reveals the (oov) of the church', 'this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being (oov) i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly (oov) actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the (oov) and how much (oov) he was faced with after i saw this movie there was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone', \"the most amazing (oov) (oov) movie about the (oov) of the (oov) far better than any other film or movie made about the (oov) thus far if you haven't seen it hop on a plane to (oov) lake and see it now you won't regret it you truly get a sense of what the first (oov) had to struggle through putting complete and total faith in there (oov) joseph smith you finally get some sort of (oov) of the things the (oov) had to fight through and the (oov) he and his people faced if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter days (oov) and our humble (oov) just watch this movie it will make complete and total sense (oov)\", 'this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen i headed up with about (oov) people to st george and we saw this movie in the (oov) center of the st george

and (oov) of the story of the (oov) and the (oov) they faced because of their beliefs i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the (oov) that the (oov) went through after all it is apart of american history', \"this movie makes a statement about joseph smith what he stood for and what the (oov) church believes with all the current media (oov) of a certain

(oov) from the (oov) church (oov) is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all it's points about joseph also point away from the (oov) of the (oov) church and their leader at this time in the media world this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that some of the most obvious differences between (oov) and joseph is portrayed in (oov) humanity (oov) and love (oov) views and opinions (oov) greatly from joseph smith and the (oov) church and it is seen in this movie (oov) thinks of the (oov) as (oov) joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his (oov) favorite horse to a african american former slave to buy his (oov) freedom joseph is shown doing (oov) for his wife emma and is (oov) by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing (oov) is a way to help and (oov) your wife (oov) brought one of his (oov) wives to her (oov) in front of a class full of students by (oov) her (oov) and (oov) it painfully till she came to her (oov) (oov) joseph (oov) with law (oov) and (oov) aid from the government at all times (oov) thumbs his nose at government and (oov) at all times i loved this movie and if you don't know much about joseph smith and what the (oov) church believes then this is the movie to see and if you had confused the (oov) church with the (oov) church then you really need to get your act together we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ the (oov) of marriage and the family as well a (oov) to our (oov) and country we are all different as well just like you can find different (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) and (oov) what's important is our message and what we stand for this movie (oov) to portray that but there is so much of (oov) life that can't be covered in a mere 2 hour movie this was a really great show\", \"i really thought they did an excellent job there was nothing wrong with it at all i don't know how the first (oov) could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears i guess it moved about everyone to tears but i try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one got me it was (oov) good i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy i feel like it (oov) my faith and gave me a hope that i can't explain it made me want to (oov) to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted i guess compared to that i feel like our own (oov) are nothing well not nothing but they hardly match

story moves along quickly and we are treated to a fine character performance by (oov) the theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the (oov) man's relationship to the land and what's on it

events in the life of joseph smith whom (oov) (oov) as the (oov) of the (oov) of the true church of jesus christ on the earth i've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing joseph smith is shown first to be the (oov) of a trio of brothers (oov) (oov) joseph who at a very young age needed an operation the operation done without our modern (oov) was bloody and difficult the scene helped to show the (oov) of the smith family and the (oov) between the brothers and between joseph and his parents (oov) religious confusion and subsequent (oov) which lead to what (oov) call the first vision was (oov) portrayed the face of jesus is never shown but you see the (oov) nail marks in his hands the (oov) by religious (oov) and many in his small new york community is (oov) at least slightly by (oov) marriage to emma this movie does not clearly map out the events of (oov) church history but merely jumps from scene to scene this is not a (oov) simply a note about the style the practice of (oov) and (oov) is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a (oov) about the (oov) love with a (oov) face from having recently been attacked the movie (oov) portrays (oov) the joy and (oov) of (oov) as an (oov) church while at the same time the ever (oov) (oov) that spread into the (oov) of local (oov) the film shows many scenes from (oov) life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of (oov) life including his (oov) love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of (oov) and dangerous (oov) his religious (oov) and his (oov) as joseph and (oov) ride to (oov) never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by joseph are shown along the way helping to (oov) what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful at the end the (oov) of joseph and (oov) is portrayed and (oov) are left to (oov) the events they just witnessed when i first watched the movie i (oov) it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non members i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movie can do just that as an (oov) i find that the film is a (oov) of joseph and (oov) (oov) the good things we already know about him i am curious to see how (oov) will view the film whether they will simply see it as (oov) an epic story of an american religious man or something else the film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to (oov) in light of the many aspects of our culture including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law we (oov) take for granted\", 'i am stunned at the negative comments that i have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest this is the most moving and real portrayal of joseph smith that i have ever seen it was well acted to the point that at times i forgot that i was watching a movie it brought (oov) life of (oov) good (oov) (oov) (oov) faith in people and god and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me (oov) and silent in awe if anyone of any christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way i would have to say it is a (oov) of the individual and not the movie i give the movie a 10 and (oov) honest souls to view it at the very least it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed in a world where values and beliefs are (oov) this movie stands as a (oov) (oov) of the kind of people we are supposed to be no matter what religious beliefs we hold ann (oov)', \"i saw it at the (oov) theater in the joseph smith (oov) building in (oov) lake city this morning i'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of (oov) of (oov) story however that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score if you get to (oov) lake city it is a must to see it in the (oov) theater i have never been in a (oov) theater as far as picture quality sound quality and (oov) in my entire life i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there being that i'm (oov) and regard joseph as a (oov) i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times which i (oov) is expected since they handed out (oov) before the movie started anyway i'm told that this film is available in several (oov) (oov) centers around the (oov) if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tells a fascinating story\", 'after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten (oov) worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he (oov) through life of (oov) and (oov) for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself

read about joseph smith the (oov) this is where the story of the (oov) joseph smith begins the movie (oov) portrays his life and some of the history of the (oov) church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to (oov) out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the (oov) (oov) i would (oov) you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would (oov) you to see it it will (oov) your (oov) of this most incredible man this is a must see', 'thought at first this film would be your typical

be obviously shown in many scenes (oov) the beginning is very good in a certain way (oov) wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the (oov) in the third part there are some illogical flaws and i complain a bit about (oov) heston he has to play an old ex (oov) named sam (oov) but he is in a fantastic physical shape i never got the feeling that he really has problems to (oov) on a horse or on a rock for me he didn't looks very (oov) as he usual do in most of his epic movies same goes to the beautiful barbara (oov) who is playing the (oov) daughter maybe both had

(oov) his role and his acting is the best of the movie (oov) and (oov) are terrific the (oov) scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic (oov) (oov) and his gang had some gory and violent

great behind the scenes (oov) and some (oov) scenes including a alternate opening i do recommend you pass on the (oov) bonus feature the first film by director as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing', 'i have to say that this tv movie was the work that really showed how talented (oov) joan hart is we are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and i really hope that a tv station will show this tv movie again soon as it will show the (oov) fans that (oov) shines in a drama seen as we have watched her on (oov) now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much (oov) talent would be a plus (oov) plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves one thing that all (oov) viewers will notice (oov) works with david (oov) in this well before he took the role of (oov) on (oov) so it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again hopefully (oov) gets some good roles in movies or even in more tv movies sort of like (oov) martin who has always (oov) in tv movies lots of (oov) talent waiting to (oov) out when it comes to (oov) joan hart you shine always (oov)', 'i have seen it i like it (oov) plays her part well it was actually believable my brother in law saw it with my sister i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story i had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true both my sister i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him i love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson i thought i saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated', \"this movie is totally wicked it's really great to see (oov) in a different role than her (oov) character the plot is totally cool and the characters are (oov) written

expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happens the film is also a great way to see the personality of (oov) and (oov) outside of their canadian television show you can see a bit

it (oov)\", \"warning minor spoilers i ran into this one (oov) through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn't know until the ending

life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they (oov) just can't be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this (oov) if you don't want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a (oov) operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn't show us that and it seemed a bit too (oov) absent the explanation of how they were (oov) to do it i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the (oov) of the explanation (oov) an (oov) of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn't have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 7 10 it made me think now i'm interested to find out the facts of the real case one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be (oov) it as a more recent movie p s (oov) (oov) is lovely i hadn't seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol\", 'the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred (oov) joan hart

(oov) but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad david (oov) future (oov) cast mate for hart (oov) joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil (oov) and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year hart began portrayed (oov) the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television although the film has dated somewhat it (oov) stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to (oov) (oov) that comes out in (oov) because it shows she can seen as

ready in case i were to (oov) over it's (oov) or (oov) you know what i mean at first you think she's just a nice ordinary girl who's in love but has mean parents then when you find out she's (oov) her

whole point is that he is haunted by the events at (oov) (oov) house for many years but does (oov) and eventually put the events behind him mr (oov) is a far more sympathetic character in the novel

that night me or my father there are many (oov) about this film that make it so creepy but i think (oov) of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie so every (oov) (oov) and bang is more (oov) in your head as there's no (oov) another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things (oov) out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running (oov) thinking whats around the corner or behind the door a superb ghost story i've never seen anything that can match it and with all the (oov) thats repeated over and over on

10 and i'm (oov) to watch it again but fear i might have some (oov) nights i can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's

black (oov) at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel like the (oov) hero (oov) whether its just imagination or not it is also one of the few films which has really made me (oov) to keep watching production values be (oov) good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film actors locations sets music attention to detail and imagination a real gem\", \"well done ghost story that will give you the (oov) and some pretty fair scares along the way the story unfolds slowly building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black you won't forget her once you've seen her no gore no (oov) no (oov) (oov) just a well constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out\", \"i first saw this movie here in the u k in (oov) (oov) when central tv broadcast it i still have the video tape although worn out over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been (oov) by it anyway i remember coming home that night (oov) a christmas (oov) (oov) the lights out and watching what was (oov) as a (oov) ghost (oov) even now i remember certain scenes that still send the (oov) on my neck standing on end i have seen some comments on the movie which say it's not this and not that i think those people get scared by friday 13th and the like (oov) and (oov) (oov) which are laughable this is a (oov) ghost story there is no big budget action or special effects no (oov) no blood no gratuitous sex scenes no (oov) or guns etc so how refreshing it's atmospheric if you like chilling horror well written well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere this is the movie for you i like the original horrors only last night i saw the original haunting and that is a superb movie very atmospheric again and so is the woman in black the end of the movie (oov) to the book but still very good i recommend it try it you will like it if you like traditional ghost stories so turn off the lights turn up the fire (oov) the doors grab a drink and enjoy\", \"i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype i was surprised at the (oov) of the (oov) image in my mind the next day and the day after that i've watched it 3 4 times and each time i appreciate it even more the settings are gorgeous the town at (oov) has beautiful lighting effects the (oov) long shots and the house itself is (oov) grown with (oov) the main hero is so likable and good (oov) that he is easily (oov) with to the person who (oov) that there wasn't enough (oov) in this film i'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being (oov) by just this one person it is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life spoilers discussion i especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost he describes the woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what (oov) had she done to him the other man says you can't go back alone and (oov) the hero his dog the cute little dog offers a small (oov) of comic relief with it's (oov) through the house and even into the locked room the many (oov) appearances of the ghost really (oov) me out the woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house this is all in the very beginning another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church (oov) watching the funeral as the camera (oov) to the right the woman is seen in the background among the (oov) the older man won't even look at it but the kids are all yelling and (oov) it (oov) usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific (oov) or people as has been mentioned the (oov) (oov) and (oov) are frightening and i feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully (oov) the ending (oov) the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house or perhaps he was (oov) no matter what by saving the (oov) girl the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really (oov) the role well i have been (oov) the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film and it is (oov) to see others feel the same i can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype i think another person (oov) it up when they said that this movie (oov) the question of whether or not ghosts could physically (oov) man (oov) i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the (oov) (oov) yeah any other films to recommend thanks\", \"whilst i have loved

solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen (oov) as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last

so scared though all three films (oov) me it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact it was the first on the bill i didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie that's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about (oov) minutes the (oov) runs (oov) but despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) shadows and (oov) gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last 20 minutes scared the (oov) out of me and made a (oov) impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection since it was a french italian (oov) it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in (oov) i couldn't quite remember the title

of terror castle of terror long night of terror etc and the usa uk working title castle of blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it (oov) but thanks to the internet and (oov) i found it at last what a treat to finally watch the film in its (oov) after so many years it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy but as haunted house movies go it's stands up well and (oov) (oov) to similar (oov) films of the period such as the haunting the (oov) or black sunday the film is a fine early effort of italian director (oov) (oov) it stars 60's scream queen icon barbara (oov) and features a well written screenplay by (oov) (oov) about a (oov) writer (oov) (oov) who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and (oov) becomes part of an (oov) (oov) (oov) story the (oov) (oov) is well cast as the (oov) love interest as is (oov) (oov) as dr (oov) and (oov) (oov) as julia many of the tricks (oov) (oov) to create the film's eerie atmosphere (oov) (oov) doors (oov) etc are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour rather than using body (oov) and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way (oov) on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances (oov) does a (oov) job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying (oov) secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the (oov) writer the film is not without faults the pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the 20 minutes i originally missed this is probably (oov) by (oov) films effort to (oov) the film to its original length though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored in terms of the (oov) it may have been more of (oov) than a help the english voice (oov) are merely (oov) and in the restored scenes the language (oov) from english to french english subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewers however (oov) films deserves kudos for the quality of the print clearly some effort was

you look at it too bad she wasn't playing a (oov) (oov) her character would have been completely believable as a (oov) among low (oov)\", \"when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long i thought we were in trouble (oov) the (oov) w (oov) (oov) novel down to a movie that (oov) in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen but you know the movie's not half bad and it even manages to (oov) much of what makes the book (oov) so much with its (oov) i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet (oov) of an actor and he was but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip (oov) than a wet (oov) for that's certainly what (oov) is howard plays him well which means you want to shake him and slap him (oov) the head repeatedly then finally take him out and buy him a (oov) ah and then there's bette as the girl with whom (oov) is obsessed and who brings his world (oov) down around him i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book and the movie stays true to that detail but as played by davis she does become the most fascinating character in the story and if she's nasty and (oov) she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time (oov) performance here is (oov) with changing the course of screen acting much as (oov) would do nearly 20 years later when he (oov) out (oov) in that little known (oov) williams play and it's not hard to see why davis is intense to the point of scary she makes no effort to (oov) any sympathy from the audience and she allows herself to look ugly and most (oov) her appearance when (oov) walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an (oov) disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an (oov) is shocking of course it helps that this movie (oov) out just before the production code went into effect if it had been made a year later you can bet things would have been a bit different yes much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really does become about (oov) and mildred and not much else i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of (oov) novel but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that (oov) are still drawn to now so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to (oov) the novel the way they did grade b\", \"today actresses happily gain weight (oov) their hair dress like (oov) and lose their (oov) for a role and bette davis was probably the actress who started the (oov) even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore (oov) clothes and (oov) (oov) type makeup in films davis was willing to (oov) herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside her (oov) is (oov) (oov) here in her (oov) film of human (oov) in which she stars with leslie howard as philip (oov) davis plays mildred a (oov) manipulative greedy low life to (oov) (oov) club (oov) philip he first meets her when she's a waitress and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she (oov) with a wealthy older man alan (oov) (oov) in truth mildred is (oov) by (oov) club foot on his part philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open (oov) and her (oov) toward him he allows mildred to (oov) him dry (oov) in between (oov) who drop her when they (oov) of her while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women kay johnson and (oov) (oov) when he gets the (oov) to throw her out mildred (oov) his apartment and (oov) him (oov) him to (oov) from medical school and lose his (oov) of human (oov) looks rather stilted today in parts though leslie howard was a wonderful actor and attractive his acting style is of a more (oov) old school and as a result he tends to date whatever he's in he shines in material like his role opposite davis in it's love i'm after or the (oov) forest which call for his kind of technique his dated acting is even more obvious here because davis was (oov) new ground with a gritty (oov) performance that would really make her name if she seems at times over the top she came from the stage and the (oov) of film acting would (oov) later for her contrast this performance with the (oov) warmth and (oov) of her (oov) in all this and heaven too or the (oov) she brought to dark (oov) she was a true actress and a true artist davis really allows herself to look like holy hell (oov) (oov) is absolutely pathetic as philip seems to gain strength as her spirit (oov) an excellent film in which to see the (oov) of one of film's greatest stars\", 'i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the (oov) and pretend we were in care a lot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get (oov) over the care bears and care a lot the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these', \"reading web (oov) on bette davis one can find (oov) where (oov) claim that there is nothing special about her acting i even found a site which claimed that bette (oov) success was probably due to her luck but ms davis films of (oov) tell quite the opposite the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart (oov) over (oov) and on human (oov) characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different (oov) in the former is a beautiful (oov) and (oov) (oov) and much more likable character than mildred in the latter which is a (oov) (oov) and (oov) (oov) waitress needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm but even that is not all the point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play the latter role which seemed to most actresses as (oov) career destroying role was the one she (oov) for (oov) for months and it was the latter role that (oov) her among the greatest stars so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing the film which tells about a medical student (oov) (oov) leslie howard which falls (oov) in love with (oov) waitress mildred rogers bette davis has a few week points but many more strong ones the story is simply too big to be told in mere (oov) minutes for example it is quite (oov) why (oov) student found any interest in an (oov) waitress in the first place well there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully (oov) nevertheless the (oov) of the story is (oov) by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic (oov) music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters' faces in fact the film is (oov) by (oov) walking sequences showing him from the back (oov) with (oov) two tone (oov) every detail is well thought max (oov) wrote a beautiful (oov) for each women in (oov) life which is consistently used through the film and a beautiful scene in which we see (oov) face in front of (oov) is one of the (oov) scenes i've ever seen exactly due to francis (oov) breathtaking beauty ms (oov) was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind as well as (oov) captivating music camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing but my (oov) (oov) is that events are presented too two (oov) which (oov) viewer that mildred is an ultimate (oov) the most disgusting characters ought to be men which (oov) her into relationship despite well knowing that they will (oov) her after taking use of her but they (oov) finished portrayed as likable characters after all mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets (oov) know that she (oov) him and had no interest in him which he just refuses to hear it is (oov) (oov) nature connected to his club foot and (oov) experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem he is (oov) to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life of course selfish and (oov) mildred after (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) to her did its own share to make his life hell even taking into account that she (oov) after realizing that the (oov) has (oov) it is less than clear why would she burn (oov) money (oov) intended different in his novel after all she could as well steal it and drunk (oov) of (oov) for modern standards the film is a bit (oov) but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark\", \"(oov) (oov) characters are brought to life in (oov) of human (oov) but the movie is a too (oov) version of the novel with bette (oov) star making performance (oov) up all of the energy otherwise it's the story of leslie howard as philip (oov) he dreams of becoming a (oov) but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr (oov) struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to (oov) some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in (oov) his painting seemed easier also note the symbolism of his (oov) a club foot explained in the film along the way right away in this version howard becomes (oov) with waitress davis as mildred rogers (oov) characterization of mildred is extraordinary (oov) in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to (oov) my mouth after (oov) him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his (oov) (oov) and love for davis so their performances are wasted still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette (oov) characterization was famous for inspiring a write in (oov) for the (oov) best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were 1 (oov) (oov) it happened one night 2 (oov) (oov)

watched it last night but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because i read the book first the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film if you plan to watch of human (oov) don't read the book (oov) on the other hand the book is so good and contains so much more than the love affair (oov) has with mildred you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie i do not make this claim (oov) i average reading a book every 4 days and read such (oov) (oov) as (oov) steel (oov) (oov) (oov) and shakespeare of human (oov) gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written\", \"bette (oov) (oov) performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in (oov) they just didn't have as much to do some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better it was but to give the film it's due to (oov) a (oov) page book down to (oov) minutes is no mean (oov) the first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen it told of (oov) childhood then moved to germany and paris where (oov) had gone to try to make good as an artist it also (oov) his first romance with (oov) price who kills herself when she (oov) (oov) cannot return her feelings of love it is a wonderful book but (oov) and i think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is after (oov) that he will only ever be a mediocre (oov) (oov) (oov) leslie howard comes back to england hoping to take up (oov) when out at a (oov) he meets a (oov) waitress mildred bette davis even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like (oov) (oov) is obsessed it is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any (oov) in this vicious (oov) in one scene she promises to meet him in a second class (oov) waiting room when they almost miss each other she (oov) him with why would i wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class

picture he meets (oov) kay johnson a lovely woman who writes romantic novels under a male (oov) she jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among (oov) in the novel he had seen mildred reading them (oov) gives (oov) all the love and confidence he needs but he is (oov) of returning her love when mildred returns miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby in the film it is treated as an object always called baby never given a name or gender she (oov) him by running off with his best friend at the hospital he meets sally (oov) (oov) (oov) who is (oov) her sick father he begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family then surprise surprise mildred returns like a bad (oov) and surprise philip takes her in but he has changed and feels only (oov) when she tries to show (oov) the only way she knows how then follows one of the most vicious (oov) fights on film with (oov) such as you (oov) you dirty (oov) i only (oov) you because you (oov) me and when you went i (oov) my mouth i (oov) my mouth in the book a lot of (oov) stock (oov) such as you're a (oov) in every sense of the word i don't mind and mr high and mighty were associated with (oov) and when (oov) meets her for the first time he is struck by that the end of the film shows (oov) being truly free of mildred in the only way possible now free to love sally again in the book sally tells (oov) that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love that ending like (oov) (oov) could not be in the film even a pre code one kay johnson was always called on to play (oov) believable women which she played to perfection as she was obviously (oov) herself her (oov) was the woman philip should have stayed with (oov) (oov) was one of the most beautiful of screen (oov) she was obviously being (oov) for (oov) with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face the silver (oov) and blood money but when she married (oov) (oov) her career started to peter out her sally did not push her talent to the limits apparently leslie howard was not very (oov) to bette davis on the set he was annoyed that an english actress was not given the part he used to throw her her lines whilst reading a book off camera he did start to take an interest when a newspaper (oov) the kid was running away with the picture highly highly recommended\", \"this (oov) adaptation of (oov) (oov) novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on (oov) so her studio didn't push for her her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards as the (oov) waitress who (oov) philip a sensitive medical student around and nearly ruins his life davis is way too (oov) almost (oov) director john (oov) who usually (oov) good performances from his actresses was perhaps (oov) by this one davis is watchable for sure but so (oov) and (oov) as to seem (oov) human i imagine the character of (oov) as (oov) less (oov) than davis with maybe a touch of the (oov) davis is such a strong (oov) presence that's there's no air of mystery to her which makes (oov) attraction to her seem more (oov) (oov) than it should be as philip leslie howard is excellent his (oov) somewhat (oov) good looks are perfect for this failed (oov) nor does he (oov) a personal interpretation on the part as say (oov) (oov) might have done which gives his work a rare (oov) he seems completely in control here as he should be playing a man with a (oov) (oov) who is in the (oov) of (oov) emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy as the object of his (oov) moves him in ways he cannot understand howard was a fine actor too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm which he doesn't use here it's been so long since i've read the book i don't feel comfortable (oov) on the movie's (oov) to it i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough and that it has in howard a perfect philip (oov) the sexual (oov) are (oov) and at times philip (oov) so (oov) that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's (oov) surely not mr (oov) intention thanks to (oov) performance philip remains (oov) in focus as one can see in his various (oov) to and (oov) for (oov) the (oov) to which a reasonable (oov) will go to understand the (oov) in himself and in others overall a very good film a little stilted at times due to its age it (oov) london nicely and is well acted for the most part\", 'i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about (oov) leslie howard childhood considering that at the time not much can be shown on the screen not that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with mildred bette davis is very well (oov) to the audience i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her i have read that (oov) was asked to make a recording of the novel for (oov) but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was (oov) one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of a part of it at least', \"bette davis turns in a (oov) amusing performance as mildred rogers in this (oov) film the film seems rather dated now in 2003 it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie (oov) today it was (oov) for me to see how young ms davis looks in this move the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting leslie howard is well cast as philip (oov) the club (oov) medical student this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why however of human (oov) didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally i felt slightly (oov) and (oov) about the movie after viewing it i have an (oov) that this may be the reaction that the director was going for you be the judge\", \"the story is somewhat stilted what with the main character's sudden (oov) of fortune but leslie howard and bette (oov) (oov) of philip (oov) the (oov) obsessed lover and mildred rogers

unlike a character howard was to play a few years later ashley (oov) the southern (oov) too (oov) and decent to make it in the rough (oov) era philip in fact seems (oov) to disappointment even before mildred enters the (oov) doesn't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he'll never make it as a (oov) it is perhaps this (oov) these (oov) expectations that makes him put up with the selfish (oov) waitress for as long as he does although leslie howard is memorable today of human (oov) is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of (oov) energy mildred may have a (oov) voice but she also has the (oov) beauty of a (oov) glass angel making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be (oov) along for as long as he did although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional she does (oov) sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and (oov) realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her one may also think she is on to something

gave me the (oov) for some reason one of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see bette davis coming into herself right before your eyes she's great not necessarily because this is her best work but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious gritty and (oov) as an actress in (oov) bette was a risk (oov) always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it if you're a true lover of film it's amazing to see she just had a way of delivering a line that made the part and the film for that matter belong to her like a mass of music and fire that's me an old (oov) and some (oov) or but you are (oov) you are in that chair or with all my heart i still

twice leslie howard was gorgeous so calm and (oov) (oov) to be loved i thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him but then again everyone was except mildred he did a great job the only thing that i didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films they'd make a character so (oov) that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place the performances were great but in real life philip would have never been interested in mildred that's just the simple truth see it\", \"this is a well

light (oov) comes on a little and he kicks her out she does what she knows works so she tries to (oov) him well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his (oov) money up oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to (oov) up about it he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he (oov) her along still waiting for mildred well he has no school (oov) can't find a job finally sally and her dad takes him in not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again she has (oov) meanwhile he is still leading sally down the (oov) path about marriage and he takes a job on a (oov) finally the (oov) dies and (oov) (oov) he is free now and he will marry sally i wished she told him to stuff it now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points but i feel (oov) was the bad guy yes mildred is a (oov) but he knows it and he keeps coming back mean while he has two other (oov) who love him but he treats as (oov) i guess the sex wasn't as good but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he (oov) to do about baby apparently the (oov) name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy (oov) father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old (oov) philip doesn't seem to (oov) his feelings either men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as (oov) yes she was not a (oov) woman but far from a villain to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred\", \"i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human (oov) never has moved me (oov) i first saw the film on my college (oov) in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and (oov) howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by (oov) (oov) as the man who was born to be (oov) this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley (oov) as a man who might be (oov) if he and (oov) (oov) were meant to be an (oov) by margaret mitchell but ashley loved (oov) not (oov) howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry (oov) is not one who is (oov) one can make the case that philip (oov) scott is (oov) by the two (oov) he shows (oov) to in (oov) parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal (oov) canadian fair game to double cross in (oov) it isn't the same as emotional (oov) and howard does not (oov) up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be (oov) or try to be (oov) witness his (oov) (oov) (oov) in the (oov) (oov) but that character was not (oov) except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by (oov) (oov) the character of philip (oov) in (oov) (oov) of human (oov) is (oov) too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a (oov) but unlike the artist (oov) in the moon and (oov) he has no real talent so he decides to (oov) on medical (oov) (oov) by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low self (oov) who is set up to be (oov) philip finds that (oov) in the form of mildred a (oov) waitress bette davis who is (oov) and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really (oov) in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy (oov) ticket ironically in being so (oov) by this (oov) philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and (oov) (oov) and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself (oov) davis when she has (oov) with other men alan (oov) and (oov) (oov) the latter a friend of (oov) although (oov) performance captures the (oov) (oov) of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured (oov) in gone with the wind that he loves (oov) de (oov) not (oov) (oov) has more (oov) with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to (oov) like the girlfriend of the (oov) (oov) in the man who played god or the spoiled (oov) who gets murdered in (oov) over (oov) or the mouse like secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish (oov) (oov) her performance was not all of one note while she uses and (oov) howard for two (oov) of the film (oov) in that famous scene where she shows how (oov) his (oov) of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health (oov) and her (oov) to keep any honest jobs when howard (oov) her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says (oov) that he is glad which is hardly the response she (oov) in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a (oov) ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend (oov) on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and (oov) did fail to (oov) davis in (oov) leading to the (oov) write in (oov) in it's history and a (oov) change in it's rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as (oov) (oov) in dangerous and in two years she co starred with howard again as equal stars in the (oov) (oov)\", \"every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth (oov) before davis co stars with leslie howard in of human (oov) (oov) been in over a score of movies legend has it that davis was (oov) of a (oov) oscar for her performance as a (oov) speaking waitress (oov) mother manipulative boyfriend user mildred rogers the story goes that the (oov) (oov) davis by (oov) her 1st oscar for playing (oov) (oov) in dangerous i imagine (oov) fans of of human (oov) who agree with the oscar (oov) legend are going to have at my (oov) contrast of the (oov) film for which the (oov) didn't award her performance the (oov) film dangerous performance for which she received her 1st oscar in (oov) i've tried to view all of bette (oov) motion pictures tv interviews videos (oov) for wwii tv performances in popular series in (oov) it is easy to recognize why this film of human (oov) gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance she was only (oov) when the film was (oov) just about to reach hollywood's red (oov) the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in of human (oov) that is what makes it her legendary performance but (oov) saw her (oov) in the man who played god borrowed her from (oov) to play rogers i'm going to go with the (oov) in (oov) some (oov) years after their (oov) decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for dangerous 2 years later by doing so the (oov) may have been (oov) in bringing out the very best in one of hollywood's most talented 20th century actors because from of human (oov) (oov) davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden (oov) (oov) she deserved more than 2 oscars perhaps as many as 6 dangerous provides an (oov) contrast in (oov) depth of acting characterization for it's in dangerous (oov) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century davis is so good as (oov) (oov) she's dead center on the red (oov) whereas in of human (oov) davis is right off the edge still on the (oov) ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career perhaps by not (oov) her that legendary oscar in (oov) instead of a star being born an actor was given (oov) to reach beyond (oov) into her soul for the gifted (oov) greatest work it is well known that her contemporary (oov) (oov) was joan (oov) a star whose performances still don't measure up to (oov) even anna (oov) smith was a (oov) howard (oov) is a radio host (oov) too lots of people on stage the silver screen are stars few became great actors the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star struck try comparing these two movies as i have viewing one right after the other maybe you'll recognize what the (oov) i did davis was on the (oov) of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at (oov) achieved her goal by the time she was (oov) she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached yet had the (oov) sent her the message that (oov) arrived in of human (oov) (oov) life history as a great actor may have been led into star struck (oov) instead\", \"coming shortly before the (oov) of a morality code (oov) the spirits of

easy to re watch is of course the (oov) performance given by the young bette davis she not only steals every scene that she's in but is actually much (oov) and better photographed here not to mention (oov) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio warner brothers this film was made by r k o radio pictures she wears a very (oov) make up and has very attractive (oov) and oh those lovely big eyes especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in (oov) (oov) her body was so (oov) when she was young get a load of it in the cheap (oov) that she wears for her big (oov) (oov) scene with leslie howard and oh boy she is an absolute (oov) in that scene howard is a little too nervous throughout but he does captures the (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) scores as the sweet pretty young sally who truly loves him max (oov) score is both charming and poignant splendid performances and (oov) (oov) make this the must see version of the classic novel\", 'several features of this film immediately date it the sound is rather (oov) and one realizes what great (oov) have been accomplished in sound (oov) in the (oov) years the language of the dialogue is rather (oov) and (oov) and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career i do feel however that somehow the (oov) accent does not fit the facial expression i think it is the (oov) (oov) accent that does not ring true for me (oov) (oov) loves to (oov) into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie (oov) as in so many of her character roles bette davis can switch from a beautiful (oov) woman to a (oov) full of (oov) hatred leslie howard is well cast as the (oov) english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a (oov) little waitress towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street they cross through the (oov) completely (oov) to a (oov) of (oov) and (oov) screaming at them this scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film it is probably (oov) to send you home with a smile on your face and after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending', \"this movie even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving strong film bette davis as the (oov) vicious (oov) waitress mildred is absolutely believable watching her performance is still (oov) she makes the viewer absolutely (oov) her and pity her at the same time leslie (oov) performance as the weak obsessed (oov) (oov) is not as strong but i don't see how any actor could hold their own against ms (oov) performance she (oov) up the scenery in every scene she is in totally stealing the show this is the movie that (oov) her (oov) and she deserved to win the academy award but lost it was shocking for it's day what with themes of (oov) (oov) multiple sex (oov) and (oov) vicious language so it is somewhat dated but still an excellent movie just to see the scene where mildred tells (oov) what she really thinks of him you (oov) you dirty (oov) is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film\", \"this movie does (oov) the first one as far as the (oov) of the care bears and the care bear (oov) goes i won't (oov) that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then it's a very good movie i remember watching this in the early 80's and fitting into its (oov) (oov) audience then and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie not that i didn't enjoy that one too it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it sure it's darker than the first one too but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good and it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too that kids may not fully understand but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off and adults watching will surely get (oov) as i have now watching this film again now in my mid (oov) where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit demon in (oov) for something else get the picture but simply watching that as a child sure as i said it may have been a little scary but nothing (oov) in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age i can't tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to (oov) me have me help him capture the care bears tried to make me turn over to his dark side and other things like that etc so this movie was also good for my imagination and it's also got great emotional depth to it too i used to watch it at least once a week also (oov) kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart i always thought so and i always will now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie as good as it is what good is love and caring if it can't save her\", \"spoiler alert w (oov) (oov) classic on film about a love obsessed young man who's (oov) hurt and (oov) by the object of his

in law calls him and (oov) that his (oov) karen (oov) blair might be (oov) in his apartment and he desperately asks (oov) to leave his place in a (oov) (oov) he finds that her has (oov) and later in the (oov) of his wedding dinner party he realizes that (oov) is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia (oov) and (oov) blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds (oov) in his bed when he finds her (oov) his imagination in many situations in the (oov) trying to buy and get (oov) about the (oov) (oov) most of the scenes of his neighbor the (oov) when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of (oov) paul i could number many other scenes but better off the (oov) rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seven title brazil (oov) (oov) (oov) crazy for them', \"as a child i (oov) the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for (oov) but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesn't seem as dark as it was back when you were a child this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may (oov) the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the (oov) are just too adorable i (oov) that (oov) my (oov) scene i tend to (oov) everyone by singing it the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean (oov) i love every song in this movie i have (oov) them all and is all i am listening to i'm listening to (oov) (oov) also known as (oov) at the moment i have always (oov) this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol (oov) song in the first movie (oov) a (oov) i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprising there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weird strange i think it is a wonderful movie basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any (oov) (oov) with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality\", \"romantic comedies can really go either way you know you'll see one that's really sappy and you'll think you want something more realistic then you'll see one that's realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested or maybe you'll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you smile romantic comedies are tough movies you go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the (oov) was (oov) your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you of course if you've got a girl next to you and you're a guy like me it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good you've got other things on your mind for you i say go get her tiger for the rest of us i say see a guy thing it's a lot of fun because a guy thing knows you're going in to this movie with expectations so it doesn't pretend that its guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and it's not his wife plot is going to make everyone happy sure maybe you like it but maybe it doesn't ring true or you think it's cruel a guy thing covers that what a guy thing does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time so if you don't the main (oov) you've still got something to make you smile whether we're talking about the (oov) (oov) of big and small screen like larry miller pretty woman best in show james (oov) (oov) julie (oov) airplane david (oov) saturday night live and (oov) (oov) regular dirty work (oov) powers ii or thomas (oov) the state and (oov) variety or new faces like (oov) (oov) the (oov) or (oov) (oov) saving (oov) we're talking about a bunch of very talented and (oov) actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired (oov) steal the show time after time and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days and that's not to (oov) from the actual romantic (oov) and the stars that carry it along because it's very sweet and terribly well done jason lee (oov) chasing amy (oov) etc is touching as the young professional whose life may be (oov) out of control and (oov) blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the (oov) (oov) and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is a lot of the success of the movie though falls on julia (oov) the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wears it well not since (oov) i don't know when have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy of course it's all in the (oov) the voice and the subtle (oov) but it's magical and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place but julie (oov) slightly (oov) (oov) would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead on in their classic simplicity this is a movie that (oov) a broken world of (oov) stock types makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then comes through with a great deal of heart a guy thing is a movie you've definitely seen before and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it we haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely (oov) upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl a guy thing does (oov) that with a bit of a (oov) edge often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to (oov) the powerful emotions and ancient plot (oov) at play for the record it also even manages to (oov) fun at the rather traditional (oov) (oov) of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy so even the (oov) out there might get a kick out of it and guys i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie i'm not going to spoil it for you but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the (oov) and the clothing store (oov) are among the (oov) (oov) in cinema i suggest you just say it's a guy thing and leave it at that\", \"i was literally (oov) to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and (oov) to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has (oov) and tries not to let his boss future father in law and co workers see him (oov) himself isn't terribly intelligent but it sent me into a (oov) of laughter very few of the film's gags are high (oov) but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james (oov) character since he was a (oov) in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the (oov) in the plot a total witch the (oov) blair character is hardly (oov) and there's never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywood (oov) but it could've been much more (oov) the cast is talented i haven't had a (oov) view of most of jason lee's mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin (oov) films that i couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these (oov) roles and he never looks comfortable in these (oov) roles even in this movie he doesn't look perfectly comfortable but he (oov) his own two (oov) and effectively (oov) each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia (oov) proves again why she's so damn likable of course she's a very beautiful girl with a (oov) smile that makes me want to (oov) but she also (oov) a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i don't know the (oov) name but the woman who plays the drunk (oov) is hilarious julie (oov) also has a small part and she's always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to (oov) her skills don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office (oov) this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be (oov) down the toilet so it's always to see a good one among all these bad (oov) my score 7 out of 10\", \"this movie starts out (oov) has some slow moments in the middle but generally moves along well has a few very good moments then (oov) out at the end of act 3 i was able to get to see this in la (oov) 2 times with 2 different endings jason lee is a star but he is not (oov) leading man he is humorous and holds his own but he is better served as a supporting actor julia (oov) does (oov) in a comedy role new for her but she doesn't (oov) this movie the way a star of her caliber should for an actress who has so much potential 10 things save the last dance o it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so (oov) and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie like daniel day lewis did in (oov) (oov) blair is a good young actress as well and does an (oov) job i didn't expect an academy award performance from her and she didn't deliver one but her performance was adequate chris (oov) delivers another film that is (oov) (oov) perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else i (oov) like this movie but it is not a movie where you walk away and say (oov) was great ' this (oov) has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here the (oov) dinner scene was probably the best in the movie and larry miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role he could be the best surprise of the film if you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have an enjoyable evening i can still recommend this film but unless they have changed the ending again leave during the church scene or you will surely be disappointed\", \"first a quick (oov) up ' to those saying this movie stinks you can't go to every movie expecting (oov) (oov) this was actually a fun movie jason lee is good in everything he does the only flaw in this movie is i don't think there was enough (oov) between lee and julia (oov) they should have (oov) more on that other than that the movie is good fun (oov) blair needs to eat something she's (oov) me but she still looks beautiful so yes i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun go see rating 1 2 out of\", \"i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn't live up to the trailer it's a little more (oov) and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie however if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it's still pretty good julia (oov) is clearly the star she's so (oov) and (oov) that set among the (oov) of everyone else she just (oov) and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lee's (oov) filled (oov) his elegant mother in law his (oov) friend jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of (oov) and (oov) that make (oov) stand out in the first place lee doesn't live up to his (oov) i don't think but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to maybe that's one source of disappointment the movie itself despite a bit of (oov) and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the (oov) intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of (oov) and taking the safe (oov) seemed to cleverly (oov) on several (oov) for example there was the whole (oov) of how he would imagine (oov) but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the (oov) talking about how everyone (oov) or just how everything (oov) blair and julia (oov) characters said and did was (oov) by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the (oov) choice the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a (oov) comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the (oov) guy turning out to be a good (oov) and some (oov) on his part gets away with it for the most part while it wasn't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of (oov) talent but overall it's still a good movie\", \"what would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his (oov) party with some of his closest friends at a (oov) guy bar all smooth (oov) until he takes his (oov) hat off what would you say about him talking to one of the (oov) dancers and then sleeping with her what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his (oov) a new low right well paul (oov) played (oov) by jason lee leads this experience of a (oov) (oov) and a new low i got to say this is one of his good leading roles however i do believe his role in (oov) sky was better acted his (oov) named karen is played by the up and down actress (oov) blair while (oov) character (oov) is played by the lovely and talented julia (oov) getting back to where we left off paul now has to deal with one (oov) problem to another he gets (oov) has to deal with certain people and has to play his lie games with (oov) or any member of each of the families could get p (oov) including one of his relatives that hasn't had a (oov) movement for 14 days (oov) all of this leads to the long (oov) wedding with one hilarious scene before it (oov) all the hell that paul and his brother had to go through overall a guy thing is quite funny and is all right sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie and if you're a canadian and a fellow fan of the (oov) (oov) butt sitcom corner gas you'd recognize a small role played by fred (oov) the same man who plays the hilarious hank in the series this movie is all right it's another (oov) in lee's hat quite an empty hat so far however my rating 7 10 (oov) a\", \"paul jason lee is an (oov) who just happens to be engaged to a type a princess named karen (oov) blair she chooses his clothes and his daily (oov) at his (oov) party paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named (oov) julia (oov) back to his (oov) nothing happened as they say but the duo do wake up in the same bed suddenly karen (oov) she's on her way to (oov) apartment (oov) paul (oov) (oov) out of the place although her (oov) are left behind but there is even more fun ahead at a family dinner at (oov) (oov) home paul runs (oov) into (oov) again learning that she is (oov) cousin talk about some explaining to do but instead paul chooses to (oov) a stomach problem and (oov) out in the bathroom will karen ever find out that (oov) spent the night at (oov) place and what will be the consequences i'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this they should definitely (oov) up for this film is fresh and fun of course it doesn't hurt matters that lee is a (oov) funny man (oov) is a charming beauty or that blair is a natural as a pretty but (oov) (oov) the rest of the cast including james (oov) and julie (oov) is also quite nice the look of the film is wonderful as are the costumes and california settings best of all the script is imaginative and inspired creating big laughs for the audience in short if you want to (oov) the (oov) (oov) get this movie tonight it may not be academy award material but it is absolutely (oov) to turn a bad day into a (oov) good one\", \"(oov) the morning after his

everywhere the (oov) (oov) at the (oov) and at his parent in laws dinner and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed it is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival comments actually much better than expected not the sweet romantic comedy i expected but something much funnier something with a little edge this movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half (oov) and deep in trouble as he is here and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia (oov) and (oov) blair and actually i thought (oov) (oov) did a nice part as the ex so more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good i enjoyed it very much 7 10\", \"i think this movie got a low rating because it got (oov) by it's worst moments there is a (oov) joke and an embarrassing (oov) (oov) scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia (oov) manages to be pretty damn funny herself apart from that this movie (oov) like most romantic comedies after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end which is better than most of them where you already know after 5 minutes anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick (oov)\", \"i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while (oov) channels my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie in (oov) guy (oov) jason lee plays paul a straight (oov) (oov) based fellow who is about to marry his (oov) karen (oov) blair and settle down to an (oov) life of middle class (oov) we first meet paul at his (oov) party where he (oov) no desire to engage in any of the normal (oov) party type activities his surprisingly few buddies (oov) in case he's a bit (oov) and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and (oov) of course the next thing paul knows it's the morning after the night before he's in bed with a naked (oov) dancer and his mother in law (oov) to (oov) him that karen is on her way over oh and the (oov) dancer is (oov) cousin (oov) julia (oov) from this small (oov) of potential trouble grows a mighty (oov) of (oov) (oov) as paul (oov) from (oov) to (oov) trying to cover up what he's done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a (oov) family (oov) good guy who's super excited about his (oov) (oov) his efforts to (oov) karen remains none the (oov) about any potential wrong doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun loving (oov) (oov) him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been (oov) out for him the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance definitely worth a watch\", \"i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea i think the dark heart character is a little on the rough side and i don't like the way he shape (oov) into a mean (oov) fox (oov) i was wrong this movie was made for my kid not for me she gets it when it went over under my head of course i don't get it this isn't one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing there isn't any political junk (oov) there's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves nobody has the right to access (oov) and everyone isn't happy all the time and as a side benefit nobody dies (oov)\", \"in my opinion a guy thing is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy i thought that jason lee and julia (oov) (oov) as a (oov) (oov) to be and his soon to be sexy cousin in law if you ask me they lit up the screen like magic you can also feel their chemistry between them before i wrap this up i'd like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed in conclusion to anyone who's a fan of jason lee or julia (oov) i recommend this movie you're in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it\", \"the lady from (oov) is well known as one of hollywood's most troubled productions (oov) original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to (oov) this made the already (oov) mystery story even more difficult to keep track of they post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the (oov) of the irish accent and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done most (oov) of all welles and his on screen and real life leading lady (oov) (oov) were falling apart in their relationship and their (oov) chemistry comes through on screen fortunately this is all overcome by just how fantastic orson (oov) direction is he makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric every scene just seems to be (oov) down your back from the screen also the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on (oov) and surreal this sense of (oov) (oov) scenes that are often found in these films such as the (oov) sequences in the middle i typically find (oov) dramas a bore but (oov) direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else the ending at the (oov) reminds one of david lynch almost the acting here is also very good despite their failing relationship welles and (oov) both give decent performances their (oov) however are just a bit lacking everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though especially (oov) (oov) and glenn (oov) the lady from (oov) obviously has its problems but its worth watching just to see one of (oov) masters at his finest 8 10\", \"i did no research on the film

stick orson and (oov) in the player and i'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure on the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they (oov) straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and then well it becomes murder mystery of (oov) (oov) and much (oov) michael (oov) orson

good light relief by way of a court case with (oov) (oov) (oov) lighting up proceedings yet the film is an (oov) and in fact it's a (oov) viewing experience because as i was to find out after studio (oov) cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only (oov) to us the viewer but (oov) on (oov) vision i'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been (oov) and (oov) (oov) as it is (oov) we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at (oov) but remains a (oov) (oov) film that i'm glad i own to (oov) further 8 5 10\", 'one reviewer notes

more i particularly love how other actors (oov) with him on film many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o (oov) there even towards the end when his beauty was ruined perhaps by his own intent he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in (oov) was a gorgeous blonde a (oov) turner look alike but perhaps even (oov) and even then the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute another film another hour in his company that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost (oov) cut from his films because we know we all know that there

shadows and of course the (oov) hall of (oov) finale that is as classic a piece of (oov) (oov) as any in citizen kane or the trial the only faults i find with the movie is (oov) ill (oov) irish accent

(oov) aspects of the cinematography the lady from (oov) didn't quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film that's mostly people talking with each other in various situations that's quite a problem the lady from (oov) ended up at a very low c or a 7 for me the lady from (oov) is really all about orson (oov) character michael (oov) (oov) sees (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) in central park on a (oov) ride and hits on her later he saves her from a (oov) and she takes a shine to him (oov) is a (oov) from ireland and the (oov)

gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far i'm not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he (oov) writes directs and (oov) most of the screen time i haven't seen anywhere near the majority of (oov) work yet but i've (oov) to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance (oov) i love f for fake (oov) et (oov) (oov) for example and i even kind of like his performance in (oov) (oov) (oov) when he (oov) (oov) on being allowed to do magic tricks at a (oov) table but citizen kane (oov) never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7 the same as my current score for the lady from (oov) (oov) performance and the dialogue he's written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me he's a bit of a (oov) a bit of a (oov) and a bit (oov) he tends to sound like he's reading his performance reminded me of what i've seen of (oov) version of (oov) dick listed on imdb as 1999 but (oov) in (oov) it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band (oov) where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he's (oov) (oov) dramatic i'm also someone who almost never (oov) about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too as for the other performances i can only say i thought (oov) did an excellent job of course she's gorgeous which doesn't hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles (oov) also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me i never quite bought his character his (oov) and so on and (oov) is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn't seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and (oov) almost always has some over exaggerated (oov) expression on his (oov) face (oov) the lady from (oov) is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap (oov) although the soap opera (oov) tend to be (oov) from a (oov) (oov) once (oov) introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from (oov) becomes a crime mystery film it's too little too late and it quickly turns into a (oov) drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative (oov) the ending is more action (oov) less dialogue heavy more (oov) and exotic in settings and at times fairly (oov) welles (oov) that combination of material (oov) as a director if the lady from (oov) would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the (oov) ending it could have easily been at least a 9 the final scenes are easily (oov) as welles (oov) from a (oov) suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese (oov) park the (oov) climax uses cinematography that was (oov) for its time it's well (oov) with the script as it allows a complex resolution and (oov) a lot of symbolism the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can't make up for the problems in the (oov) welles (oov) scenes with skill there are lots of (oov) filmed settings from central park to (oov) to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates (oov) (oov) for his action from the (oov) (oov) and (oov) drops of (oov) to the (oov) like (oov) streets the beautifully (oov) and (oov) shots of the san francisco (oov) and so on the romance material for which the (oov) serves as one backdrop is (oov) (oov) with a kind of (oov) throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from (oov) much more than i did and of course it's worth a watch if you love (oov) (oov) the lady from (oov) isn't exactly a terrible film in my view but it's (oov) close to not passing (oov) with (oov)\", \"this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self (oov) and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a

couldn't be worse the girl sees what she's done she feels (oov) and then changes and then she helps this dark (oov) creature learn the human quality of love the (oov) improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen

in film at this point was to raise money for his theater indeed (oov) his own projects is what (oov) him to seek out acting jobs he made lady from (oov) for his soon to be ex wife (oov) (oov) harry (oov) was (oov) for (oov) image and held back the release of this movie for one year the plot concerns an irish (oov) michael (oov) who falls in love with else (oov) stunning with short blond hair her husband is a well known criminal attorney arthur (oov) (oov) (oov) who is as (oov) on the inside as he is out he (oov) (oov) to work on his (oov) and there (oov) is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and (oov) the lady from (oov) moves at a (oov) pace though i agree with one of the (oov) that films today are (oov) for taking time to build a plot still this movie drags the scene in the fun house is fantastic welles wanted it without music though and i believe the studio cut it down it's a shame the photography throughout is stunning atmospheric bold and very stylish welles was an excellent actor handsome in his youth charismatic and (oov) a magnificent voice and technique but in many films it's almost as if he doesn't trust himself or doesn't take the time to develop a character instead he relies on (oov) such as accents and fake (oov) one of the only times he didn't do this was (oov) is forever where the director gets an excellent deeply felt performance out of him contrast that with (oov) where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he (oov) in his performance here welles is doing (oov) duty as director star co writer and narrator (oov) a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization nevertheless he is always compelling the supporting players are excellent including (oov) and glenn (oov) (oov) gorgeous and soft voiced her singing was again dubbed by (oov) (oov) is as usual a complete (oov) and one of the great screen (oov) what a sad life for such a (oov) beauty any film that orson welles directed is worth seeing and the lady from (oov) is no exception but this one leaves the viewer frustrated as does the magnificent (oov) as does any work that welles did within the studio system he was a great artist who should have been given a (oov) (oov) he wasn't he was a strange (oov) he needed more freedom but as is (oov) by some of his later work he needed the structure of the studio alas he couldn't have both\", \"the lady from (oov) is weird even by the standards of its (oov) director orson welles whose last hollywood film this was for many a moon it's a kind of post modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular and it concerns a happy go lucky irish (oov) played by welles who falls in with a mysterious lady (oov) (oov) who was married to welles at the time and her (oov) and probably (oov) husband played with a (oov) (oov) (oov) by (oov) (oov) a long sea (oov) follows with welles in (oov) as (oov) and the plot (oov) when

and all sorts of (oov) follow for welles and his (oov) and at this point the story (oov) and told at a (oov) pace thus far goes off the deep end and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and (oov) its story does not by itself (oov) and the result is a very watchable and often (oov) at all times incomprehensible mess it's hard to know what welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe (oov) his career in hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife but self destruction (oov) as it often does with welles and miss (oov) has never looked less (oov) that she is also cast as a (oov) (oov) seems (oov) as aside from her beauty her most appealing (oov) as a screen personality was (oov) a quality she does not (oov) in this picture the director himself is strangely (oov) and (oov) at (oov) the presumably (oov) (oov) since welles for all his many (oov) was not known as an easy man to work with this is a role that twenty or thirty years later sean (oov) or robert (oov) might have been able to breath life into welles does not the most interesting performance in the movie is glenn (oov) as (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) law partner (oov) works wonders with the part and is photographed to look bizarre while his scenes end on odd (oov) notes and are often (oov) edited but for all this he manages to make (oov) (oov) (oov) and disturbing and (oov) in a (oov) way the more (oov) method actors of the (oov) such as timothy (oov) there is a question that (oov) me about this film what was welles trying to say he was a highly talented and intelligent man and (oov) to make (oov) in his movies which whether one agrees with his world view or not were brilliantly put forth i think i have an answer or a (oov) one welles was (oov) up his movie career he had reached the end of his (oov) in the hollywood studio system he (oov) and he knew it the lady from (oov) isn't exactly a nose (oov) at the studio (oov) of the day but i suspect that it is in its portrait of (oov) rival big shot (oov) read producers (oov) (oov) opinion of the power (oov) of hollywood that he presented himself as a (oov) (oov) is telling welles himself was certainly an (oov) (oov) and he rarely lived in one place for long he was hired by a studio to provide it with a big (oov) film citizen kane which caused a (oov) of (oov) from which he never fully (oov) this may be the issue that (oov) not speak its name in this film which is to say (oov) personal failure in not getting over the shock of his (oov) in the movie (oov) and his (oov) to deliver the (oov) as promised the mere fact of him turning up in hollywood like his mere presence in the film could not (oov) (oov) well beyond his control that he presented himself in the movie as an (oov) naive (oov) shows a lack of self knowledge on (oov) part he was much more of an inside player than he let on and i imagine that he (oov) his knowledge of the

ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all (oov) filmmakers\", \"a great and truly independent film that hit most of my emotions and carried me into another world isn't this why we go to the movies i was especially impressed with the editing and the music the combination of which was very (oov)\", 'this low budget digital video film has (oov) in the right places writing and acting in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far in low light (oov) the (oov) video (oov) tone (oov) but surprising it (oov) film stock for (oov) (oov) and (oov) in (oov) lit situations this is (oov) (oov) film making at its best with (oov) dialogue carrying a midnight cowboy kind of story about (oov) doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco', \"i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end i found the director (oov) style of directly (oov) me the audience very engaging what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its (oov) and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes the (oov) of the characters are portrayed as (oov) and the absence of (oov) and the characters' (oov) of themselves and each other (oov) me to (oov) them and allow myself to be drawn into their world without (oov) and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals i look forward to more (oov) from this creative and talented director\", \"the movie only enter the cinema in (oov) this year 2007 two years after it's official release and after many illegal (oov) had found its way to the public apparently the popularity of the illegal (oov) lead to the release into the theaters with still public coming to watch the movie is a great epic bringing japanese culture into your house in an (oov) way in a sometimes (oov) way the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater since the regular (oov) theater plays is something he finds boring at first the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following but when the story unfolds we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new (oov) theater piece the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese (oov) and (oov) but that doesn't matter the way the story is told with a love for theater expression vivid colors humor and tragedy makes this a great ride on the (oov) (oov) of japanese cinema as well as theater let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home one critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying though most of it is great music there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for (oov) moments in music as well\", \"i went to see (oov) as 2005 (oov) festival (oov) man that was one cool kick off the director was supposed to be in (oov) for the canadian (oov) but due to health reasons he's still in japan oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies the plot is pretty simple but somewhat original the demons are (oov) in (oov) in japan and (oov) called demon (oov) are (oov) them and (oov) the (oov) of (oov) the demon (oov) who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick ass it brings us to (oov) some kind of (oov) (oov) called demon (oov) and his buddy (oov) who's the typical violent jealous (oov) seems boring well now it (oov) (oov) took his (oov) from killing demons since he (oov) a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her so (oov) went on with his life and (oov) himself in (oov) theater in a boat (oov) on a nice night (oov) spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and (oov) to (oov) demons for the good cause the cause of love and damn the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre (oov) carries the movie as far as playing goes he is the total (oov) he knows how to fight hell yeah he knows he's witty he's intelligent and he has that (oov) you never have to (oov) no (oov) it's a trap the guy already knows it he has that common sense he's really the perfect hero as far as cinematography goes the (oov) are pretty interesting it's by far the movie that looks the most like a (oov) it's (oov) full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic it's pretty amazing lots of (oov) an unreal photography other than that it's pretty (oov) but like i said the main character is carrying the movie a must see a tale lead by masterful hands\", \"japan is in serious trouble demons have (oov) (oov) taking (oov) of (oov) forms and (oov) them to their (oov) will on top of that the (oov) of (oov) queen of the demons is (oov) the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the demon (oov) a (oov) group of (oov) who might just be as bad as the demons themselves (oov) is a (oov) demon (oov) who five years ago took up theater instead of demon (oov) after accidentally killing a innocent child in a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from (oov) till dawn one night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named (oov) their (oov) (oov) literally and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies if you think this sounds like your typical japanese fantasy (oov) epic you'd be wrong in fact there's nothing typical about (oov) it is a (oov) (oov) of many different (oov) of film those just mentioned as well as a comedy drama and romance director (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) the (oov) fairly (oov) although the comedy seems forced in some scenes and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie to be sure there are flaws in the film some of the humor seems contrived and out of place and the acting isn't the greatest but seriously do you watch fantasy (oov) comedy films for the great acting performances no we watch them for the action and the crazy cg visuals all of which (oov) has in (oov) not to be (oov) the film is not all action but it is (oov) out (oov) enough with lots of (oov) and (oov) of green blood to keep the average viewer happy bottom line the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good (oov) action the reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same their sure to be (oov) by this fun and silly (oov) fantasy action flick my rating 7 out of 10 fun popcorn movie\", \"set in japan (oov) is the story of demons taking over the earth the premise is far more complicated but the (oov) storyline should not be forgotten japan is in (oov) with demons (oov) human form (oov) the (oov) generally speaking demons look and act like humans but are evil the japanese word they use is not just demons but rather the classical form of (oov) which is a (oov) creature of some (oov) (oov) we're talking about creatures that would appear more like (oov) than simple ugly child eating monsters however in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress in order to save the world from demons there are demon (oov) trained and (oov) (oov) who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon and who guard the (oov) way between the (oov) of hell and that of the real world these are the basic (oov) the story begins with a festival in a local town (oov) these (oov) 3 men ride in dressed in all black seemingly intent on doing (oov) the (oov) run (oov) those which are (oov) in nature who turn green eyed and try to kill them the demon (oov) end up killing off the majority of the demons from here the story gets interesting the whole essence of the story begins when at the (oov) to hell a fortune telling demon appears before the 3 (oov) (oov) revealing the arrival of (oov) with it comes the end of the (oov) of man and begins the (oov) of demons (oov) however requires some form of (oov) process the first step of which occurred during the opening battle but which won't be revealed to you until you see the film the 3 demon (oov) are a wise old man a powerful yet (oov) man and a (oov) and (oov) warrior immediately you can see the split between them the old man wanting to stop the demons the powerful one wanting to (oov) them to his (oov) ego (oov) wishes and the third looking to stop the second along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to and believes himself to have a special relationship with she in turn is a (oov) who is good (oov) (oov) after by (oov) when the two finally meet face to face he places his hand on her (oov) and suddenly she is (oov) by a mark on her (oov) needless to say the mark is not a good sign what ensues is a battle for earth a battle between both good and evil as it should be but also between good and good itself the point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would i came in thinking it would either be a fast paced action style film with demons or a horror film with (oov) evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in (oov) and (oov) on i was however mistaken in the best possible way the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play and it plays itself out as such (oov) the essentially action driven (oov) scenes with a great concept an amazing narrative and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit (oov) in gore many scenes are painted with (oov) dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a hollywood film it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away the film makes use of some (oov) scenery and camera work (oov) to many great samurai films of our days but adding to it a well thought and classical plot with great acting great music and thoroughly stunning scenes its a must watch in my book that being said it does need the (oov) that it is not for everyone its not cheap thrills horror its not balls to the wall action its a horror style play thats been filmed it has very much to say and takes the time to do so flying in the face of the conventional one liners like japanese plays the (oov) between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene if you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity then you can easily watch something else overall this film to me is a unique and amazing one which keeps you (oov) and (oov) it has good writing good acting and good direction it is all in all a (oov) great film\", \"for the (oov) time i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie well last summer i watched them both together and decided i was wrong the first one is a better care bears movie as you may have guessed if you read my review for it this one isn't a bad movie it's just very strange well first of all as a few people have mentioned it completely (oov) any knowledge of the first movie i can't think of another sequel that (oov) the original so (oov) especially with the (oov) of some characters and how they all met when i was little and watching this i was quite a bit confused and (oov) i felt the same way watching it as an adult on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good if you (oov) it from the first movie i can't think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it's (oov) now i am not for a minute (oov) that evil demons who want to steal the souls of (oov) and care bears are good i just find it cool that there's a (oov) evil being in a movie for little kids it's like that (oov) santa (oov) vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes (oov) the (oov) name is (oov) and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers very dark for a (oov) flick (oov) and did i mention that (oov) appears to the girl most often as a (oov) voiced 10 year old boy (oov) meanwhile some other kids are in care a lot looking after baby care bears oh man demons and baby care bears in the same movie needless to say everything gets (oov) up in the end but not before we get to see (oov) trap the care (oov) souls in this scary (oov) thing in one surprisingly deeply disturbing scene but i am left with the question of (oov) this movie has found the cult audience it so (oov) deserves i might just watch it again myself\", 'very good drama about a young girl who attempts to (oov) a series of horrible crimes she (oov) the aid of a police (oov) and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling (oov) worker with a long police record an ending which is (oov) to keep you on the edge of your seat', \"this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main (oov) is that it seems like it was made for tv full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close strange too since (oov) shows that it was rated r nonetheless very (oov) and i wish (oov) (oov) made more movies like this one (oov) reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is i'd like to find out though because this movie was that good (oov) d in (oov) 8 (oov) 2005\", \"i thought this movie was wonderfully (oov) it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin (oov) was hot (oov) but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death i was inside you i think that's what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she's too young when he never cared how old the other girls were now i don't think i myself could ever trust a cop like that but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way and that was funny when she (oov) him in the eye in the store (oov) she was still stupid for going into the (oov) again by herself and so was the cop who died hello it's called back up sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things but that's what i think an thought about the movie\", \"i saw true crime when it was first released back in the mid (oov) and i have watched it many times since it is a great mystery about mary played by (oov) (oov) a high school (oov) in a california town who's (oov) younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer mary meets tony played by kevin (oov) a police (oov) who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer many suspects in this one true crime feels very true or real to me i read a (oov) review where someone wrote that total (oov) of disbelief is present here and it is so true (oov) (oov) is perfect in this role and kevin (oov) and bill (oov) do a great job as do the other actors the locations are right on and the writer director pat (oov) really captures some of the (oov) of teenage life and of (oov) (oov) see the scene where mary (oov) from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of tony i wish (oov) would make more movies i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime 10 10\", \"i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting it was at least not like the teen slasher movies that pop out every now and then the search for the killer and the (oov) relationship between the hero the so called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie also i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie i mean it's exciting maybe some time later i might watch the movie again\", \"i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it i would recommend it to other people it comes on lifetime movie network quite a lot and i am thinking since it's close to halloween they might play it more so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it i believe that (oov) (oov) played her part very well i really like her as an actress and person she seems so nice and down to earth kevin (oov) he's performance was so so for me i am not trying to knock him or anything but i believe that his brother matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better kevin just seems too sweet for me but i think he did okay\", \"this is the best made for tv movie of all time am i saying this because i'm a huge (oov) fan (oov) but even without her i'd still see it i'm a fan of serial killer genre films and believe this to be a great entry in that category also mary (oov) easily ranks among (oov) top five character (oov) totally memorable like she really exists i'd have her on my side too if there was a mystery to be (oov) she plays the character like she does with her real life with complete confidence in everything she does seems sweet honest nice just like she is in real life so is that acting yes indeed she's sort of a rebel once again this time she's not bad she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law but she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do instead she spends her time reading detective (oov) and (oov) crimes a cliche (oov) she's sort of (oov) her father's death in a different way than (oov) style at the time (oov) seemed to be playing the same characters (oov) (oov) without a parent a (oov) this happens here too but she's a bit (oov) this time around that doesn't matter she's still cool as a (oov) check this out soon or else (oov) will be (oov) why you haven't\", \"i (oov) out this one after seeing the hilarious and (oov) challenging (oov) (oov) perhaps (oov) (oov) best known effort from early in her film career true crime has kevin (oov) which should be (oov) in (oov) most film projects in fact everyone in the cast does a good job the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite (oov) grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a (oov) adventure (oov) (oov) is pretty good in this one she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing (oov) that (oov) mary (oov) as she (oov) towards the truth behind the serial murders i (oov) her characterization of (oov) has some (oov) in it too the (oov) of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law (oov) it could be really interesting for an older (oov) to (oov) (oov) at a time of crisis later in the (oov) life just a thought true crime shows its director in a good light pat (oov) also has the writing credit i don't know of any other film work (oov) has done i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although bill (oov) detective jerry (oov) is hardly that over the past decade he seems to have been able to (oov) an impressive number of screen appearances i recall seeing him recently in (oov) (oov) a made for tv presentation with a military theme bill (oov) played captain (oov) fans of the classic us tv comedy show who's the boss may also have an interest in (oov) because the leading player is (oov) light remembered with (oov) by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show true crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing\", \"i must admit i'm a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to (oov) i think its a great horror sci fi film colonel steve west alex (oov) returns to earth after an historical space flight to (oov) while in space he (oov) some bizarre and unknown disease he (oov) up in a hospital bed he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting (oov) the (oov) (oov) he (oov) out in some local woods surrounding a small town unfortunately he starts to develop a (oov) growing (oov) that can only be satisfied by eating other people he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive (oov) human (oov) he begins his (oov) of terror its up to his old friend dr ted nelson (oov) (oov) to find him and try and help him he has to work alone as his boss general perry (oov) (oov) wants it kept ultra quiet nelson can't even tell his wife judy ann (oov) however sheriff blake (oov) (oov) becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local (oov) start turning up half eaten i don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews what do people expect anyway i really like this film the star of the film are (oov) rick (oov) special make up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent and the fact their all (oov) effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better writer and director william (oov) isn't afraid to use them either we get some nice long (oov) close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well even now photography music and direction are a little bit dull but professional enough the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster shots of him looking (oov) into ted (oov) house or when he sees his own (oov) in some water and (oov) (oov) the ending set in a large factory of some sort is pretty (oov) so don't expect any happy ending which surprised me also the script doesn't really do anything with the premise he just walks around melting and killing with his friend trying to stop him maybe a bit too simple personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital (oov) in slow motion her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too it looks and sounds totally ridiculous you need to see it to believe it i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70's and 80's horror sci fi fans a bit of a favourite of mine\", 'to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low budget sci fi as a kid in the 50s thats all there was in (oov) i saw the first man into space in a movie theater with my dad it had (oov) (oov) starring and some other poor (oov) who got the title role it is also about a space mission gone bad where the (oov) turns into a (oov) killer scared the good plenty right out of me the memory of those (oov) (oov) still lives within me the incredible melting man is almost a re make only in full glorious color that is (oov) the scenes were well lit just gotta love it for what it is a little over an hour of (oov) lit scenes disgusting (oov) and that eerie music (oov)', \"i (oov) this short on a dvd of best new (oov) shorts all great but the french doors was amazing it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen just as you

effects it (oov) you right to the bone a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and (oov) up the most (oov) but spooky situations the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story it is a quality short that i haven't seen in quite some time the french doors has all the (oov) of a great feature alas it

the famous late 70's gore film featuring rick (oov) wonderful makeup effects baker was just on the edge of becoming a (oov) and did this at the same time as his famous (oov) aliens in star wars for some strange reason star wars became a household name and incredible melting man did not it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind (oov) awful from the opening credits starring alex (oov) as the incredible melting man that's really what it says to the (oov) nurse running through a glass door to the (oov) head going over a (oov) and (oov) (oov) apart on some rocks

more awful to put in your (oov) than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most (oov) (oov) persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable it's incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he (oov) and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he (oov) completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to

friend dr ted nelson (oov) (oov) this is often so (oov) funny with enough absurd lines and situations to go around that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional it seems to me to be kind of a (oov) on low budget genre efforts from the (oov) and 60's and as such it's a (oov) entertaining movie that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious we're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a gas to watch writer director william (oov) deserves credit for coming up with this (oov) idea his ultra (oov) character is a memorable one indeed i think his pacing is a little off some scenes like the one with the elderly couple go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid (oov) b movie (oov) with a degree of (oov) the

that one of his eyes pops out hilarious the hero of the film is played by (oov) (oov) a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin (oov) (oov) slightly twisted (oov) and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv (oov) horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is (oov) as one of the finest movies ever made in (oov) which is where i suspect this film was made as well the (oov) cold looking rural (oov) (oov) are certainly the same and the (oov) that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell (oov) off flying alien (oov) in without warning which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an (oov) connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the (oov) which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan (oov) is a part of melting man's cast essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot (oov) for later 1970s era special effects the inevitable (oov) the movie it probably (oov) most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter (oov) as an (oov) who also returns to earth after being exposed to (oov) (oov) effects that set him off on a killing (oov) one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations he simply goes on a (oov) and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also (oov) low and every (oov) spent on it is up there on the screen rick (oov) disgusting effects getting the (oov) share of whatever was spent on this sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why can't people have made more movies like these 8 10\", \"the incredible melting man is a (oov) gross trashy and (oov) z grade production that every self (oov) camp horror freak simply has to see for him herself the

the (oov) of a horrible disease that makes him (oov) and causes him to (oov) in shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him steve (oov) out of the hospital leaving a trail of (oov)

is (oov) entertaining and contains great make up effects from the hand of rick baker the melting (oov) face looks like a (oov) (oov) and his heavy (oov) makes him sound like (oov) (oov) another big advantage is that william (oov) screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific (oov) or emotional (oov) the (oov) starts right away and (oov) until the very last moment of the film just enjoy

some reason to have a (oov) jane (oov) festival on sunday nights this (oov) with a twelve year old movie length version of emma last sunday more recent versions of three other novels (oov) (oov) (oov) and (oov) park are to come the curious thing about this production by a e television (oov) with script by the ever (oov) andrew davies is that it appeared almost (oov) with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring (oov) paltrow and (oov) a (oov) version starring (oov) (oov) which (oov) the plot to (oov) hills perhaps as a result even with kate (oov) in the lead this production (oov) without (oov) as a general rule much is lost when novels are (oov) to fit feature movie length the (oov) one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters an outstanding example is (oov) (oov) which had 13 50 minute episodes back in (oov) you only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of pride and (oov) in 2005 with the brilliant (oov) six part tv mini series it's not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones (oov) wonderfully to film (oov) is a recent example but novels of the jane (oov) sort need some time and space to (oov) their full charm given the (oov) of this type of adaptation this production is ok kate (oov) gives emma the right mix of self (oov) and (oov) and mark strong is a (oov) mr (oov) he reminded me that jane (oov) to (oov) characters \\x96 (oov) is a more (oov) version of the moody mr (oov) of p p (oov) (oov) was a rather (oov) (oov) but (oov) (oov) got the (oov) miss (oov) perfectly \\x96 (oov) (oov) on speed (oov) (oov) as (oov) (oov) father was also excellent we saw the (oov) countryside the (oov) and the poverty as well as the (oov) (oov) in case anyone thought this was a particularly (oov) age for everybody even though this was a (oov) adaptation it was oddly slow in places \\x96 some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the (oov) of the times i'd have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and (oov) well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come\", \"this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can (oov) say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane (oov) masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether it's very light and (oov) you don't see the darker (oov) of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the (oov) of some of the plot points such as the (oov) (oov) (oov) is so much (oov) over as to be virtually non existent but if you want the characters (oov) out a bit more real and (oov) the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate (oov) is masterful at showing the little (oov) of the character you see her look (oov) (oov) at some of the more simple conversation of (oov) smith yet she shows no (oov) for having ruined (oov) (oov) until that action has the effect of (oov) her own (oov) happiness at the ending you see her (oov) and it (oov) frank (oov) in that they would do (oov) to others to achieve their own (oov) for emma it was playing (oov) and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her (oov) to marriage for frank

(oov) and (oov) paltrow are convincing in their (oov) but (oov) is more (oov) and (oov) while (oov) (oov) is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one\", 'the minute i started watching this i (oov) that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue (oov) both of these brought us the excellent (oov) production of pride and (oov) so my only (oov) here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and (oov) the acting was superb with i think (oov) (oov) excellent as miss (oov) but i loved kate (oov) and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually (oov) a swear word (oov) (oov) was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and (oov) i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd', \"i really loved this version of emma the best kate (oov) was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as (oov) the only complaint that i had was on mr (oov) i can't believe that a man could (oov) so much or be so selfish with his (oov) life she was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane (oov) movies were shot the settings are so (oov) it makes me want to visit england so much (oov) well as ireland and (oov) i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines (oov) with (oov) most (oov) i am glad that i got to see this one as well\", 'until the (oov) there had never been a film based upon jane (oov)

a well to do family in (oov) england she is (oov) (oov) better off than most (oov) (oov) such as elizabeth (oov) or (oov) price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main (oov)

was so (oov) to match her friend with a man she (oov) with good reason as an (oov) marriage partner for herself this being a jane (oov) plot emma turns out to be less of a committed (oov) than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further (oov) today in (oov) kate (oov) is a hollywood star but in 1996 despite being only a year younger was not nearly as well known (oov) as (oov) paltrow she is however just as convincing as (oov) well (oov) but often wrong headed heroine (oov) seems to have a gift for classical roles she made a delightful hero in kenneth (oov) version of much (oov) about nothing and i sometimes find myself wishing that hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in (oov) like pearl (oov) or (oov) i (oov) jeremy

things is perhaps closer to the (oov) of the novel than was (oov) (oov) this was the more small scale of the two versions being made for television rather than the cinema and the sets and costumes seem less (oov) and there are (oov) big names among the cast costume drama however is generally something that british television does well and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version both are entertaining and well made versions of (oov) novel 7 10', \"old (oov) (oov) tale seems very popular these days i have lost count of the number of versions going around probably the reason is that her (oov) are our (oov) even at this late date this tv mini series gives it a (oov) telling suitable to the novel (oov) (oov) emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the (oov) of jane (oov) world may seem a tad artificial to us today if you haven't seem emma i'll only say that self (oov) emma does get her (oov) it's worth watching to find out how the acting (oov) here go to the ladies kate (oov) lucy and (oov) they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane\", \"this (oov) guy is a real genius the movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and (oov) i didn't know what a (oov) girl was before i learned it here\", \"kate (oov) steals the show (oov) too bad (oov) (oov) as good looking as jeremy (oov) mark strong did a fabulous job (oov) (oov) was perfect as (oov) father i love the end scene which is an addition to the novel but well written when the (oov) is in and (oov) (oov) with his workers and high society friends emma must show that she (oov) this now she is a changed woman that is too much too quick but ok i'll buy into it (oov) bond plays (oov) ex (oov) and (oov) she is wonderful just as i would have imagined her i believe that when the uk does a jane (oov) its the best american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality see this one\", \"it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but i fell in love with it i was always (oov) with the other emma (oov) and (oov) (oov) as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn't seem natural it seems put on sorry but don't think (oov) and (oov) did a brilliant job there i could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on i was disappointed that mr (oov) was not better looking but he is convincing i also like jane (oov) better played by (oov) williams i never (oov) to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version come to think of it besides mr (oov) all characters are better played and a lot less over the top unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more (oov) pity i also love the new scene at the end well done to kate (oov) therefore if you are a jane (oov) fan don't forget to watch this one\", \"i've really enjoyed this adaptation of emma i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again though it only (oov) (oov) minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a (oov) way all the characters are well portrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma (oov) sense and (oov) as a (oov) i particularly appreciate the perfect (oov) of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the (oov) (oov) pride and (oov) but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate (oov) did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane (oov) said she would create a (oov) no one but her would love she is (oov) but has just enough youth and (oov) to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr (oov) not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by (oov) (oov) mr (oov) in pride and (oov) even the end scene the (oov) festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank (oov) whereas in the novel she was thoroughly (oov) with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the (oov) had she been in his situation a strange (oov) from the (oov) otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other (oov) from jane (oov) novels\", 'this has long been one of my favourite (oov) of an (oov) novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and (oov) emma is a (oov) and relatively faithful tv version of (oov) novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary (oov) that (oov) (oov) at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more (oov) to (oov) character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate (oov) walks the fine line between (oov) and the social (oov) with a grace completely lost in (oov) (oov) (oov) version (oov) (oov) (oov) blonde (oov) suit her attitude and character as the (oov) that (oov) her role in previous (oov) is replaced with the (oov) we know from the book (oov) (oov) role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the (oov) and the gentle (oov) that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much (oov) (oov) film', \"i've seen this movie after watching (oov) version i've found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy (oov) more (oov) than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better (oov) (oov) anyway both versions are good but anyone that loved (oov) books should watch this movie i agree with (oov) andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the original 10 out of 10 my 2 (oov)\", 'of the (oov) of (oov) films from the (oov) this is my favorite more even than (oov) which was the one that (oov) me to (oov) before seeing this emma i had seen two previous versions but in one emma seemed all wrong more like lady (oov) and in the other she seemed half wrong like a possible (oov) whereas here she seemed just right young and silly and (oov) in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production (oov) the charm of the novel (oov) well indeed it is one of the

out for (oov) (oov) a fine (oov) actor between so many stars in contrast to today's movies here only the (oov) only people matter but at the same time it is not a (oov) film too worried trying to be

frankly more at ease probably for a lot of reasons but we can (oov) that she was no longer making her first talking picture so had (oov) quickly without comparing always one film to the other this anna (oov) is still the same (oov) play with too many words his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her (oov) are here but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway there are some scenes missing the (oov) island section is (oov) and isn't as good but overall it's a direct (oov) of the first film the director (oov) (oov) (oov) french is simply (oov) what was done already which i assume must be a (oov) experience it's interesting to see both films in (oov) because they are (oov) out exactly the same way not only the sets but the shots are all the same there is an occasional scene (oov) from the earlier film some of the storm (oov) but also a brief scene where marie (oov) from the english language version is walking with her friend on a (oov) over a (oov) drunk as can be but they are just (oov) and when the next scene shows their faces we see the german actors taking their parts there is no (oov) (oov) for sure but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance clearly the themes (oov) (oov) (oov) daughters turning to (oov) and the troubles of finding true love have strong (oov) back then especially with european (oov) garbo (oov) plays a swedish young woman\", \"after (oov) introduction to sound in (oov) (oov) anna (oov) (oov) (oov) made a german version of the movie where all of the cast except for garbo were different while the

films i feel the right to compare the two closely (oov) productions is (oov) (oov) film different is it better than (oov) (oov) in this analysis i would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common they have (oov) sets very similar scripts and the same (oov) presented scenes here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life here you also have the humorous though a bit (oov) sequence in the (oov) park however when (oov) garbo herself i (oov) the first difference she does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking the viewer (oov) more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to (oov) viewers garbo was very good in american film and she is also very good here yet to me she seems even more genuine in the german version it is (oov) that garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much the effort that was (oov) created by the (oov) garbo talks her german is not very well (oov) yet no one cares everything is perfectly understood therefore i can easily say the same i did in my american version comment (oov) (oov) garbo yet the film (oov) in one very important issue the rest of the cast here comes the question which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure the differences are filled with (oov) (oov) (oov) or (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) friend does not do the equally great job as marie (oov) in the role of (oov) (oov) she is not bad she is different sometimes (oov) from today's perspective but is no longer that genuine in the role as marie (oov) who still (oov) us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time some people even claim that (oov) was better than garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth (oov) shall is more sympathetic as matt than charles (oov) but when (oov) to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the (oov) of looks who shines in the german anna (oov) who is really worth greatest attention is (oov) (oov) in the role of chris (oov) (oov) father george f (oov) vs (oov) (oov) is like a day vs night difference (oov) portrays a real (oov) (oov) a man with hopes with fears who (oov) the care of his daughter the scene of (oov) first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of (oov) conversation with (oov) is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance (oov) is the chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you (oov) with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic (oov) in your mind great if you have seen the american anna (oov) and have a chance to get the german version i would highly recommend to you this movie because it's a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine (oov) to (oov) (oov) movie and (oov) a wonderful chance to discover a (oov) of performance (oov) (oov) (oov) or

three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performances (oov) direction was more (oov) than (oov) (oov) and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as (oov) by

stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and (oov) any other (oov) could not give when people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually (oov) things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act (oov) occasionally leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more (oov) and important achievement also the message about love and power of it is (oov) little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the (oov) mind to be (oov) and found another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many (oov) tend to do when they write their movies people just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element just think about the films of the japanese film maker (oov) (oov) his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other (oov) of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts otherwise chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then i give chinese ghost story 7 10 and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre\", \"i can't remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie (oov) is such the (oov) of a hero

fashion ghost story telling there's nothing scary about it that's not the theme it's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts so the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost this also takes place in ancient china with wild (oov) kung fu (oov) and a trip to hell more or less some of the stop

that although (oov) has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan the women still long for a better life this reminds me a lot of the movie streets of shame though streets of (oov)

the old but (oov) master particularly the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable another thing that is missed here (oov) always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing probably that was his magic on set while shooting and just maybe this script was not fully up to par

(oov) this film as not (oov) best work perhaps not his best but even at his worst (oov) is better than many of the best this story is so based in (oov) the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time

those who thought it was a boring (oov) movie i'll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is (oov) work of is life and i'm sure that

burning horrors this one doesn't go for the money shot early on but unlike many the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer and if the (oov) that he used actual human

chris walken this movie is creepy and creative the plot twists are lovely if a tad predictable the climax of which i will give no detail is disturbing and quite impressive again a better director could have done more with it nonetheless it is quite satisfying at least to those with the (oov) of seventies horror if you like modern (oov) body (oov) torture fantasy you won't like this there is almost no gore the direction is quite (oov) the effects are few although there's some delightful makeup near the end most of which actually isn't makeup but perhaps i've said too much already i've

as it is on dvd it's even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen although it has been about 9 years since i have seen it it is still one of my all time favorites at the risk of sounding trite they just don't make 'em like this anymore if (oov) sense (oov) you out at all this movie is definitely for you great storyline incredible cast of characters (oov) setting even the soundtrack has a

a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i don't care if it's not the most well put together movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non

action movies like the first three (oov) in the death wish series for example are easy (oov) to (oov) down because they (oov) (oov) violence and the personal use of (oov) but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres \\x96 like the religious horrors of the (oov) for example \\x96 he doesn't stand a chance with any of the critics the (oov) generated some (oov) and (oov) several people upon its release when it (oov) that michael winner cast genuinely (oov) and (oov) people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the (oov) between hell and earth pretty much the exact same (oov) caused (oov) (oov) masterpiece and (oov) in horror cinema (oov) to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years and why just because certain (oov) and easily offended people who shouldn't watch the movie in the first place claim it's an (oov) thing to do i don't suppose michael winner or todd (oov) held these people at (oov) or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place another major reason why critics didn't (oov) welcome the (oov) is because jeffrey (oov) novel \\x96 and thus michael (oov) screenplay \\x96 is (oov) (oov) of other contemporary but far more successful (oov) (oov) horror stories and thus according to the (oov) (oov) of horror critics little more than pure (oov) admittedly the (oov) (oov) multiple (oov) elements

imagery you're not likely to forget easy (oov) parker a (oov) model with some (oov) mental (oov) moves into a stunning (oov) apartment in brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who

and she's the chosen one to guard it because the film's script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly (oov) minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and (oov) sequences michael winner successfully (oov) the impression that (oov) own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her (oov) odd behavior are strictly red (oov) multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like (oov) flashback or her first (oov) with the priest (oov) the whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here

especially considering the (oov) still remains a (oov) horror movie and this genre isn't the most popular among (oov) actors but of course you also have to put the cast (oov) a little into perspective with such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin (oov) and john carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others like christopher walken jeff (oov) (oov) (oov) and tom (oov) perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to (oov) curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to (oov) (oov) as the (oov) neighbor and (oov) (oov) as the (oov) police inspector the relatively unknown (oov) (oov) does an (oov) job carrying the film and chris (oov) (oov) back her up even though he sports a ridiculous (oov) in my humble opinion the (oov) is a (oov) entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a

substance its more a case of substance (oov) style much like his first film the element of crime von (oov) uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of (oov) we the audience being (oov) as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von (oov) (oov) us down into a deep sleep until we awake in (oov) this allows von (oov) and his three (oov) to pay with the (oov) of time and imagery there are many scenes in (oov) when a character in the background who is in black and white will (oov) with a person in the (oov) who will be colour von (oov) is trying to show us how much (oov) the (oov) (oov) or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of (oov) (oov) jean (oov) (oov) is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have (oov) over the film the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von (oov) films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jean (oov) (oov) in the lead role whose blind (oov) is slowly warn down by the two (oov) sides until he (oov) in the films final act again (oov) like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the (oov) narration of von (oov) to (oov) his fate (oov) is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von (oov) has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time (oov) much like the rest of his cinematic (oov) is filled with a wealth of (oov) scenes his (oov) to (oov) and (oov) (oov) scene is (oov) not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his no (oov) (oov) turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark

against machine i don't think that's true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren't particularly (oov) or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i'd say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical (oov) (oov) what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news (oov) and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth (oov) and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but (oov) and worth a listen read there is also a well done and (oov) making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10\",

excellent traditional animation style and sets a compelling world it shows how the machines were (oov) and that humanity (oov) the (oov) of their own destruction there is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time the short (oov) themes and a style to the classic silent film (oov) partly the beginning with the (oov) they are the themes of (oov) the (oov) of the working class and racism the short also has some religious themes and religious (oov) mainly that men saw themselves as god and created the machines in their own (oov) seeing themselves as the (oov) masters of the machines the machines too use religious (oov) mainly (oov) their nation in (oov) of human (oov) and the machines coming to the united (oov) dressed as adam and eve offering an (oov) the animation style is beautiful done in the traditional anime style like (oov) the set designs are great combine futuristic with (oov) cities e g washington d c there is well down future scene and surprising violence which is key to the film the director (oov) (oov) also directed the anime sequence in kill bill (oov) 1 so has good (oov) to hollywood he is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going the only real complain is a continuity (oov) to the first matrix film because (oov) mentions that the humans have no historical (oov) or know who started the war but its a good watch', \"warning spoilers ahead this short is part one of two that (oov) upon the brief portion of the matrix in which (oov) explains how the matrix came to be because we already know the story the

cold colors aid the purpose of the short a couple problems the violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and combined with the occasional (oov) of political (oov) un scenes (oov) from the straight narrative of the short plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete the (oov) concept is brilliant and despite a few issues this short still (oov) its purpose it would not have fit in the

made in usa 1980s it's far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and (oov) far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to (oov) issues such as prison rape these are rather (oov) done i

an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very (oov) the gore is well done and used (oov) look out for the excellent (oov) (oov) death the action is (oov) when used it's true that there are (oov) lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget it's hardly

would be fun and yes bad prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box i sat down and watched and (oov) and (oov) found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with (oov) expectations in mind fortunately i (oov) mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total prison tells the story of an old (oov) prison being (oov) to save on (oov) concerns it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a (oov) of a man being killed via the (oov) chair we see lane smith as a guard (oov) away a (oov) before (oov) the man to his maker we then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting (oov) to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that (oov) are acceptable as she (oov) (oov) against re opening the old prison then we see the new (oov) lane smith haunted by a nightmare in bed and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years well the rest follows suit prisoners and (oov) arrive with plenty of stereotypes (oov) we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a (oov) job (oov) (oov) as a very different prisoner being solid tom (oov) tiny (oov) and (oov) kane really (oov) the (oov) of their stereotypical characters (oov) field is okay as the female lead the best performance is by lincoln (oov) an underrated character actor as (oov) a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret prison is not the next best thing to (oov) (oov) or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it i was pleasantly surprised at the way director (oov) (oov) created a story so visually atmospheric the film has a tense (oov) pace and (oov) knows how to build his scenes there are a few (oov) shot gore scenes the one with the (oov) (oov) was a bit much as was the one with all the (oov) but these scenes are visually creative and interesting the acting is (oov) decent the script actually much more (oov) than one usually gets from films like these that may in part be (oov) to (oov) (oov) who wrote the story you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday here he makes (oov) a hell of a lot more (oov) than it already is give prison a break get it', \"what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films so could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated prison is the (oov) director (oov) american debut which still (oov) as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like die hard 2 (oov) and deep blue sea the story entirely takes place in an ancient and (oov) (oov) prison re opened for the cause of over population in other more modern state (oov) inside the former execution (oov) the (oov) spirit of the (oov) (oov) last victim still (oov) around the now (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) lane smith was there already 40 years ago when this innocent man was put to death and the spirit still (oov) his (oov) role in the (oov) trial it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived (oov) (oov) plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and (oov) field is the (oov) social worker who slowly (oov) the secrets from the past prison contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the (oov) tense atmosphere (oov) stick to you for certain unlike any other horror picture from that decade prison features an amazing sense of realism by this i (oov) to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls of course and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison drama sequences combined with visual (oov) and shocking horror the absolute best terror moment providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age focuses on a (oov) death struggle involving (oov) (oov) haunting the screenplay only suffers one flaw but that's a common one almost inevitable i guess clichés the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding we've got the ugly fat (oov) with his (oov) boy toy the (oov) and racist guard (oov) (oov) at all costs and \\x96 naturally \\x96 the old (oov) wise black con who serves a lifetime did i hear anybody (oov) the name morgan freeman don't (oov) yourself blind on these clichés is my advise as there are so many other elements to admire the photography is dark and (oov) the mystery is (oov) long and successfully and the (oov) (oov) roles of class b actors are excellent the fans will recognize tom (oov) tom (oov) (oov) and even (oov) horror icon kane (oov) forget about wes (oov) god awful attempt (oov) or the downright pathetic cheese flick the chair this is the only prison (oov) worth (oov) down especially considering (oov) (oov)

developed with dynamic (oov) i cared what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable the good guys win the hero gets the (oov) attractive girl and the holy child saves lives

without a kiss even (oov) humor matched up to (oov) (oov) and fire as for (oov) he played the psycho very well (oov) with (oov) calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it 8 stars', \"i was expecting this to be the same kind of (oov) as the previous modesty (oov) movie which is why i left it (oov) for so long but i was very pleasantly surprised far from being a (oov) of silly gun battles and car boat chases it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as (oov) with nothing being (oov) or over (oov) it's likely that the (oov) (oov) actually helped with that less time and effort was spent on finding ever (oov) ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching hell the biggest gun battle takes place off screen and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise that adds to the suspense who's winning who's dying (oov) (oov) might not be as drop dead gorgeous as (oov) (oov) but few are and she certainly has every (oov) of class and fire that's needed to make the character work and the shape of her face her hair and her tall (oov) body could have been (oov) straight from the comic strip graphics (oov) (oov) (oov) was the perfect choice for a (oov) bad guy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch even likable and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal (oov) (oov) as drinking buddies i can't think of a single one of hollywood's former (oov) who could have pulled the role off that well fortunately (oov) (oov) always die in the end no spoilers there that's a really good thing because all the girls who would have spent their time (oov) over such a (oov) handsome and interesting (oov) can now (oov) settle for us ordinary (oov)\", 'this is a good movie although people (oov) with the modesty (oov) comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action for the modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty (oov) history peter (oov) is listed in the credits as creative (oov) and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been (oov) to modern days the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no (oov) (oov) in the story this lack of (oov) is again just being faithful to the modesty (oov) (oov) since the movie takes place in the very early days of (oov) career (oov) (oov) makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look a welcome change from the travesty of the (oov) (oov) portrayal of modesty', \"for a first film in a (oov) series it (oov) the right balance it is done with style and class showing (oov) early days as a (oov) and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world i think it is a very honest true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter (oov) intended (oov) (oov) as modesty is (oov) beautiful and an excellent choice she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an (oov) of cool intelligent innocence and full marks to (oov) for (oov) an unknown actress for the role much more (oov) to have a new face creating the part i'm looking forward to the next film\", \"i was pleased to see that she had black hair i've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been (oov) at the two earlier attempts to film the stories i was pleased that the (oov) (oov) the period to include a computer it didn't spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as well i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty (oov) extremely well as (oov) in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about (oov) having to be ugly has he actually read the books i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with (oov)\", \"i have read modesty (oov) for several years now (oov) numbers of the strip after the (oov) movie made many years ago based on the first book modesty (oov) i was surprised the result got this good what i got was a movie not based on action or violence the director had focused on history and (oov) how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non childhood i think this (oov) will give a greater understanding to the next i hope film i simply loved the movies old fashioned style however everything wasn't that good the (oov) wasn't that good almost boring and unreal the acting could have been improved too i'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real the only reason he was there was so modesty could have someone to tell her story for also they could have (oov) the movie showing more about when she builds up the network but i'll guess thats for the next movie and please forgive me for my bad english\", \"as a long time fan of peter (oov) greatest creation i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment indeed i expected to be reaching in (oov) for the remote control within fifteen minutes but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty (oov) back story they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with (oov) instead to (oov) on a period in (oov) life only (oov) to in the novels as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography yes the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows but does it spoil the (oov) enjoyment in this case i think not instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest (oov) (oov) and given a taste of her (oov) in regard to the casting because we in (oov) territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor (oov) for me they were totally credible (oov) (oov) described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine brought to the screen (oov) (oov) and (oov) her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly (oov) the (oov) which is at the core of the modesty (oov) (oov) ok so we all know this film was produced to (oov) (oov) claim to the modesty (oov) character it was made quickly and (oov) but i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and (oov) of the original stories\", 'the movie was a long (oov) release which where a bit disappointing because of the (oov) i had set up when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok first of all is it very true to the original history of course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie (oov) history as a child is shown and is very true to the original the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the (oov) (oov) movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty (oov) or to someone who by catch it on the tv', 'while the main story is supposed to take place in (oov) this movie was shot in (oov) (oov) in 18 days on a very tight budget however broken their cards

make is that this is slightly (oov) (oov) (oov) i thought this was a thriller with a battle of (oov) between modesty and (oov) as the main plot sure there are some (oov) of action but they are not really an (oov) or important part of the story as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense filled scene is the game between modesty and (oov) it's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the (oov) at a much earlier time someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tv series and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such but i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action instead i enjoyed this game the history much more than a simple action movie i think the two main stars (oov) (oov) and (oov) (oov) (oov) did very well (oov) especially portrays modesty very well and really carries this (oov) and talented character 7 10\", \"this was the modesty that we didn't know it was (oov) at and (oov) in the comic strip for the (oov) to sell to (oov) lee and (oov) (oov) were true

story run (oov) the (oov) should also note that we really don't know if everything she told (oov) was true because she was (oov) for time i didn't rent or (oov) the dvd like other reviewers did i bought it and i don't want a (oov) i watched it three times and i didn't sleep through it great dialog and well drawn characters that i cared about even bad guy (oov) just like in the novels and comic

better than you would expect certainly much more true to the peter (oov) books and comic strip than the previous two films you can read the strip currently in the (oov) from (oov) books or in comics (oov) (oov) it is one of the greatest adventure comic (oov) of all time the movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest on the dvd extras the interview with (oov) (oov) who is obviously (oov) is a gas some people have (oov) (oov) for (oov) his name with the film but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty (oov)

the film but it has to be seen in context of the (oov) story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that (oov) her into the woman that she became before the network before (oov) (oov) the pace is a (oov) slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version if you like modesty (oov) you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it (oov) anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly', \"the best modesty (oov) movie i have seen so far it's like a good pilot for a tv series i even think it's a little bit cult like with a (oov) touch of (oov) (oov) magic or something they have caught a great deal of (oov) character but i admit missing (oov) (oov) a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter (oov) i'm not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from (oov) so i may have (oov) this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other (oov) about modesty (oov) you should definitely see this one can't wait for a follow up\", \"i've seen this movie and i must say i'm very impressed there are not much movies i like but i do like this one you should see this movie by yourself and comment it because this is one of my most favorite movie i fancy to see this again action (oov) with a fantastic story very (oov) i like (oov) character actually she's very (oov) and mysterious i do like that the bad boy is pretty too well actually this whole movie is rare in (oov) i considered about the vote of this movie i thought this is should be a very popular movie i guess wrong it was me who was very impressed about this movie and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one see and vote\", 'having heard of modesty (oov) before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her background although it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play (oov) written sadly this is also where a major (oov) of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the (oov) of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while (oov) (oov) did an excellent job as modesty (oov) her (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) as the villain (oov) did not smiling his way through the plot as if it is an (oov) (oov) commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of (oov) that would have made the movie a masterpiece the supporting cast is somehow similar from some (oov) gangsters and (oov) to decent performances from fred (oov) as professor (oov) and (oov) (oov) as (oov)', \"there's a great deal of material from the modesty (oov) comics and novels that would be great in a movie unfortunately several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character so no this isn't the modesty you know from the comic strip currently (oov) in nice (oov) from (oov) books this is modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her back story it's accurate (oov) had the movie rights to the character with (oov) (oov) acting as (oov) and technical (oov) early (oov) of the (oov) project attempted to (oov) one of the best novels but always managed to leave out some crucial element (oov) wasn't happy with any of them and offered to (oov) his name from the project so they could (oov) to the (oov) credit they wanted to keep him in the process since they knew he got the character and her world with the movie rights close to (oov) they decided to try a very different approach the result was my name is modesty a small direct to video movie that introduces the character the movie does not introduce (oov) (oov) or sir (oov) these characters are important to (oov) adventures throughout most of the (oov) stories what this movie (oov) is showing the strength of the character by herself she never loses her (oov) and you never doubt that she's in charge even (oov) in a room full of gangsters with guns most of the movie takes place within a (oov) which undoubtedly saved money on the production it doesn't matter the film does not come across as cheap instead it gives a fairly (oov) and believable back story for the character and (oov) just how far she thinks ahead should (oov) (oov) any of the comic stories or novels now they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her (oov) i realize the words direct to video don't (oov) confidence but this film is well worth a look\", \"first off i'm a dedicated fan of (oov) and have been reading the comics since i was a child and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine (oov) but where they fail this one rocks well then here we go ms (oov) is working for a (oov) a gang of (oov) comes along and she starts (oov) for her friends lives if the (oov) wins one round (oov) have to tell him about herself if she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free sounds stupid yeah well i'm not that good at explaining either she tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the (oov) camp and how they escape living by (oov) own rules they hunt for food and he (oov) her to read and fight as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for (oov) they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herself then she meets the man who's (oov) she's now working for and there the story ends what is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the (oov) are totally cool (oov) (oov) is a terrific modesty (oov) just as (oov) and strong (oov) and intellectual as the comic one feels awkward though too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but that's not relevant since the comic book (oov) can't speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat (oov) accent not to mention that it's weird (oov) speaking english in the (oov) the acting is really good even the child who (oov) the young (oov) must have a (oov) my favorite part must be where she (oov) up her dress to kick the stupid (oov) ass totally awesome d i can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie s watch it you won't be disappointed\", 'finally was there released a good modesty (oov) movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and (oov) all your expectations then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter (oov) you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is it is not a movie to (oov) new fans but a movie to tell the real tale some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from (oov) then is this a magnificent movie so are you a fan then sit down (oov) and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story', 'i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his (oov) is such a perfect contrast to the (oov) good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of (oov) (oov) through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to (oov) a (oov) (oov) but the only one (oov) (oov) gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic (oov) through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an (oov) (oov) a stunned and (oov) version of kurt russell in his (oov) fantasy (oov) like that movie we have james hong the (oov) actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since (oov) hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his (oov) the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun', \"rented and watched this short 90 minutes work it's by far the best treatment modesty has received on film and her creator peter (oov) agrees (oov) as a creative (oov) the character and we who love her are handled with respect (oov) direction is the best he's done to date and the casting was very well done (oov) (oov) is almost physically perfect as a match to the original jim (oov) (oov) of modesty a terrific find by whoever cast her raymond (oov) as a young (oov) (oov) was also excellent i hope that (oov) co will go on to make more in the series i'm especially interested to see whom they'd choose to be the (oov) (oov) (oov)\", \"although i bought the dvd when it first came out and have watched it several times i never wrote a review i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still sadly it seems it never made enough money to (oov) anyone to do a follow up i have to assume (oov) still (oov) the rights but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty with another tough female lead anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let down peter (oov) wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers the (oov) of (oov) between modesty and (oov) is very true to the source material and is tense suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions (oov) did a great job in playing how (oov) character would have taken control of the situation i find this particularly ahead of the (oov) following the (oov) needed (oov) of batman and james bond after 2 (oov) earlier efforts although not nearly as well known to the public this is really a (oov) of the modesty character and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made\", \"if you are already a fan of peter (oov) wonderful modesty (oov) books from the (oov) you will really enjoy this movie if you have ever seen the (oov) modesty (oov) film forget it that was camp this is the real modesty (oov) the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love it's a long way from joe (oov) (oov) travesty and it takes our modesty quite seriously (oov) (oov) is quite good and believable in the part and yes we do get to see her kick butt (oov) this is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty her childhood and her days with (oov) since peter (oov) was the creative (oov) on the movie everything really rings true even the story (oov) told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it having read all the books i enjoyed the movie even more for that now that (oov) has kept their (oov) on the property by having (oov) (oov) make this film i do hope to see more of the modesty stories (oov) especially as the wonderful character of (oov) (oov) makes (oov) character really come alive to that end i really hope the film does well in europe i have no idea if (oov) (oov) to ever (oov) the dvd in the usa i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general (oov) i wonder how (oov) decides where and how to (oov) it's films in the story modesty is in her early (oov) working at (oov) (oov) in (oov) the flashback sequences are (oov) done and take modesty from about 9 years old through her teens up to her current age in the movie about (oov) (oov) i'd guess i really don't think there's a perfect actress for modesty for many of us modesty fans she's much too powerful a presence in our (oov) already (oov) (oov) is credible she is very (oov) (oov) and (oov) she has lots of (oov) she has a great face one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over according to (oov) (oov) (oov) (oov) modesty has rather a (oov) figure than (oov) but i'm willing to overlook that if (oov) continues in the role i think she will mature into it just as modesty grows more powerful and (oov) as she gets older (oov) already (oov) (oov) humor and absolute (oov) very well go ahead and rent this movie it's not like anything else you've seen and even though it was directed by scott (oov) it is full of (oov) touches great camera moves lighting and well done action sequences\", \"unfortunately many (oov) who write reviews for imdb (oov) low budget with not good whatever else this movie might need more budget really isn't part of it big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another

(oov) and knowing looks are (oov) and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't (oov) her face it makes it (oov) that the bad guy (oov) played by also little known in the u s at least (oov)

heavily armed yet suddenly (oov) (oov) making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident probably the biggest problem i have with the (oov) thin (oov) playing modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an (oov) and (oov) looking guy like (oov) (oov) and beat him she just ain't a (oov) wilson or a (oov) up (oov) (oov) type actress who can throw a convincing punch (oov) (oov) letting himself be (oov) by (oov) looks like he's just (oov) with his little sister since this is not really an action film this isn't a big flaw i just hope they do better on that

were all done so well that it (oov) the creepy fear factor it had elements of the shining the (oov) sense and the (oov) in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the (oov) i would highly recommend

almost midnight so i was kinda (oov) anyway so maybe that explains why i was (oov) or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect it's basically about a couple who lose their child in a

leave (oov) as something isn't right to cut a long story short eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of it's not a

husband and wife and that's (oov) he's trying to give her more direction it's a role that men sometimes take on there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though (oov) in some ways the story itself feels very (oov) for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been

cameron (oov) eva (oov) and how ever the names of these (oov) (oov) lights are mrs christian is not a light but a sun however dark remains is also of considerable (oov) importance they idea that (oov) shows creatures of the (oov) (oov) between reality and imagination that are not visible with (oov) own eyes is not new but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the (oov) only for certain people and only to certain times this means that the photo is not just an (oov) picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an (oov) form of reality which can change as the real reality can being a sign the changing of the picture means that it (oov) the photographed (oov) i e the sign (oov) like an object now in our usual world of (oov) it is common that (oov) change signs f ex if someone grows a bird his (oov) will show him with (oov) not without as it did before but the opposite the changing of (oov) by signs would (oov) that the photo with (oov) is first and only then the (oov) grows on the man this is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie this is new and we must be (oov) for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and (oov) effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time', \"the golden child was eddie (oov) first film since his (oov) (oov) hills cop and even though it's not as good as cop it's a fun comic adventure murphy stars as a (oov) of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case his (oov) to find the title character a child with (oov) powers this movie could have been titled (oov) hills cop and the temple of doom since parts of this movie plays like a (oov) adventure kinda like an (oov) jones comedy it's got comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects lots of fun out of four\", \"allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night no one knows who killed the little girl but it's why they moved to the mountains so the couple moves into this cabin and it's haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it this movie has a lot of (oov) to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn't expect it was a pretty good movie that wasn't the (oov) movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie\", \"this movie was very good if you are one who likes to watch horror movies i recommend it the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines (oov) was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were (oov) out and screaming it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen i give it two thumbs up i definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it if you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my (oov) (oov)\", 'following their (oov) brutal murder julie and allen escape the city to find (oov) and (oov) in a (oov) cabin on a remote mountain (oov) intentions are good he wants his wife to get out of her depression by (oov) her photography julie (oov) across an ancient prison and sees the perfect creepy (oov) setting for her photography but when the photos are developed they are full of dead people and allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain dark remains is a pretty decent indie horror flick it offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension the acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great 7 out of 10', \"after all the crap that hollywood and the (oov) have (oov) out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments there are some clichéd moments but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie there's not much new here it's just done well make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often this is not a movie to watch while you're eating (oov) there's one very well written red (oov) in this movie and unfortunately one very poorly cast role (oov) christian just doesn't make an effective julie the wife mother for one thing she's totally (oov) i know i know she's just gone through a (oov) experience but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather (oov) in an unintentional way i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but i never did finally a thumbs up for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying it could easily have been (oov) with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director (oov) (oov) this is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a good old fashioned scary movie something that's rather rare nowadays\", \"finally an indie film that actually delivers some great scares i see most horror films that come out theatrical straight to dvd cable etc and most of them suck a few are watchable even (oov) are actually good dark remains is one of the good ones i caught a screening of this film at the south (oov) island film festival the audience loved it and my wife and i loved it having no name actors i assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you wouldn't know it the film looks fantastic the acting totally works for the film the story is good and the scares are great while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares they often forget about story and character development two things that help to deliver the scares more (oov) brian (oov) (oov) must know that character and story are important he develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more scared when they are in danger watching horror films that cost anywhere from 80 million to (oov) to make i find dark remains to be one of the (oov) out there check this film out\", \"what's good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most (oov) horror fan doesn't (oov) on the (oov) soundtrack (oov) for its (oov) moments even if you've seen everything there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop what could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shot on video quality in some places though it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was (oov) for and the camera work is full of needless close ups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and (oov) over what could have been more (oov) moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed it still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental\", \"for years we've been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull hollywood (oov) like saw 2 to awful indie (oov) that are completely (oov) we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little (oov) like dark remains we managed to catch a screening of this film at (oov) 2005 the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it (oov) a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category the acting and cinematography are top notch but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares the editing and visual fx are also top notch and while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit the score for dark remains only adds to it's (oov) i know the film has shown at a bunch of (oov) but none have been near me so i can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on dvd trust me even if you're sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you won't regret it\", \"if you haven't already seen this movie of mary kate and (oov) then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the (oov) (oov) that we all know and love so much it's fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath taking scenery wise of course as always mary kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway it's a great movie in every sense of the word so if you haven't already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you won't be disappointed (oov) rick morris\", \"this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action it's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is (oov) italy thats the best place ever the actors are great mary kate (oov) is such a great actress she plays charlie and thats a great character and ashley (oov) play (oov) and thats a great character to love when in (oov) love it\", \"i always feel strange and guilty saying it because i'm a fairly well (oov) non teenager but i actually sort of like the (oov) (oov) and i respect the movies they make even though i've never really been their target audience when in (oov) was a traditional mary kate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents (oov) adult romance as a b storyline fashion (oov) and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in (oov) and the other (oov) twin movies never pretend to be anything they're not most of the time they only (oov) on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another (oov) twin movie will be disappointed that said those who are fans of the (oov) (oov) will really enjoy themselves for those of us (oov) watched them since the first episodes of full house it's really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and (oov) information just like many of their other movies remember 10 (oov) street from winning london and the visit to the (oov) from (oov) to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family as long as i still feel like i'm on my (oov) and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who (oov) the (oov) (oov) in order to be a fan of the (oov) (oov) you don't have to be some pre teen (oov) girl from california in fact that's not really the target audience if it were the (oov) a fashion line of clothes and (oov) would be run through (oov) or some store like that not (oov) (oov) when in (oov) while it does feature high fashion and (oov) (oov) and two girls from a (oov) in (oov) isn't really about that it's more about inspiring young girls who have (oov) to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some (oov) foreign city with cute guys on (oov) so be it that's called marketing you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least they're (oov) a good message even if the means seem a little superficial basically don't knock the film until you've seen it and then don't knock it until you've tried to understand what the (oov) (oov) do they (oov) young girls to be creative (oov) and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids enjoy parents do the same if you like the (oov) (oov) you won't be disappointed\", \"i thought this was a splendid showcase for (oov) (oov) (oov) if you don't expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you won't be disappointed consider this a sports (oov) shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who (oov) to come between her and her (oov) (oov) (oov) who obviously doesn't want to play the sex (oov) she leaves that up to her daughter (oov) face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete 5 (oov) fire up there in the ranks of (oov) (oov) when it comes to natural (oov) a perfect 7 to 10 (oov) of (oov) to (oov) and (oov) (oov) legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal (oov) of (oov) to (oov) to (oov) to (oov) that is altogether (oov) to the eye (oov) certainly is the model for this (oov) (oov) and no flat butt to boot which seems to be the (oov) of many a (oov) babe with (oov) everywhere except in the (oov) (oov) (oov) might have used a body double in the (oov) shot of her losing her (oov) as she (oov) into the (oov) lit hot (oov) with her (oov) german guy victim no 2 but from all i could see from her (oov) shots she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it (oov) acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic (oov) (oov) with the obvious erotic lesbian (oov) her (oov) nature allowing herself to be (oov) in the hot (oov) after a long (oov) with german guy no 2 who also happened to be her mother's lover added an (oov) dimension to an otherwise one dimensional (oov) of (oov) female (oov) (oov) with (oov) murderous (oov) always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the (oov) (oov) was edited out in the (oov) version for some obscure reason (oov) (oov) (oov) facial features (oov) with her (oov) (oov) body could either be a (oov) or a curse if (oov) really wants to further her career as an actress i'd advise her to (oov) herself fully in the romance (oov) especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i don't know if they would go for her type but this would (oov) her to (oov) her bo derek face with her (oov) (oov) body but maybe her face is just a little too (oov) and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to (oov) her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the (oov) whose early fame in blame it on (oov) was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground (oov) (oov)\", \"contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk i loved this film the use of (oov) in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old (oov) come to life i also enjoyed the (oov) of people on a back screen for instance in one scene (oov) calls his wife and she is (oov) behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and (oov) is in the (oov) one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the (oov) on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of (oov) (oov) that intense constant style (oov) with the (oov) of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when (oov) finds her father dead in the (oov) you can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von (oov) his (oov) of horror which ends up making it all the more creepy the use of text in the film was unique like when (oov) character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a film the use of black comedy in this film was well done (oov) (oov) (oov) is great as (oov) uncle it brings up the (oov) i got from his role in the kingdom (oov) this humor makes the (oov) of absurd (oov) (oov) of train (oov) against the terrible backdrop of (oov) and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of (oov) in the way the hospital (oov) is trying to maintain a (oov) at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly (oov) to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are (oov) in but do nothing positive about it the voice over done (oov) well by max von (oov) is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into (oov) head which at times is a scary place to be the movie brings up the point that one is a (oov) if they don't choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where (oov) character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von (oov) seemed anti woman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters don't fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to (oov) their actions but of course they never do\", \"this might contain a spoiler so (oov) if it had been (oov) 000 thousand or two million people does it make a difference sometimes i get so angry at the apparent (oov) of a small number of strangely very loud americans but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not (oov) or raised to care about anything outside of their (oov) zone god help us for what we have done after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans and the (oov) to the horrors of (oov) a race you would think (oov) have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are (oov) to only us how then can we look at any other (oov) and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to (oov) our will we are (oov) and (oov) and i am ashamed for this i feel (oov) for the people affected they deserve justice and their (oov) back if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety i don't want it i (oov) these actions and hope our global community (oov) that many americans believe the american government is a (oov) train of (oov) no one is above the law i want my country back and so do the (oov) (oov) regardless of what people post from the (oov) of their (oov) no one can in their heart (oov) that they would be (oov) to give up their (oov) for some (oov) and (oov) we can't

in our own (oov) but makes no (oov) of how to help i don't know about britain but (oov) made it nearly impossible for the (oov) to take part in their (oov) (oov) a (oov) in the right direction might

(oov) and americans to watch to be silent in the face of these facts is to be (oov) in a thoroughly ugly crime', 'ed (oov) work in this film is up to his usual standard of (oov) that is he steals the

another (oov) it is breathtaking a master class in artistic control the other cast members are all (oov) and (oov) is (oov) as is (oov) but the story itself (oov) no (oov) the plot (oov) largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be (oov) and (oov) by white law (oov) officers this is the (oov) which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end still worth watching to see harris in action', \"this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are (oov) this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who (oov) a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for (oov) the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus (oov) the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by (oov) in this movie who (oov) the white characters then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie\", 'this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie there are many plots and turns the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or (oov) crimes committed by black people this film is very well directed by (oov) (oov) and the fine sound of james (oov) howard is excellent strong performance of sean (oov) and ed harris if you liked this one (oov) miss true crimes or the (oov) my wife and me gave 8 10', \"i've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say what is wrong with you people this was an excellent film i thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told i'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film there are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense i urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention the story made perfect sense to me and as i said was very well told every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film all the actors did a fantastic job sean (oov) was very good in his role as always (oov) (oov) was superb as (oov) brown playing a very interesting character kate (oov) was a nice touch as well and looks fantastic blair (oov) was a pleasant surprise i didn't really expect anything great from him but he pulled off a great performance ed harris was the real gem in the film he plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is watch his eyes in his scenes just superb also there is a very young (oov) (oov) as kate in one of her first roles not a bad place to start excellent cast in this film i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers this is a great film and should be seen don't listen all these other people's opinions go see the movie and come to your own (oov) i hope that you will see the film and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do thanks for reading chris\", 'as usual sean (oov) does a great job lawrence (oov) is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as (oov) turner']\n"
